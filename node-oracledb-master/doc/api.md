reference is in sections 2 - 7 and the user guide in subsequent
sections.

Documentation about node-oracledb version 1 is [here][94].

The node-oracledb API is a generic Oracle Database access layer.
Almost all the functionality described here is common across all
current Oracle Databases.  However the documentation may describe some
database features that are in specific Oracle Database versions,
editions, or require additional database options or packs.

### <a name="getstarted"></a> 1.1 Getting Started with Node-oracledb

Install Node.js from [nodejs.org][88].

Install node-oracledb using the [Quick Start Node-oracledb
Installation][87] steps.

Download node-oracledb [examples][3] or create a script like the one
below.  As well as callbacks, node-oracledb can also use
[Promises](#promiseoverview) and [Async/Await](#asyncawaitoverview)
functions.

Locate your Oracle Database [username and password][91], and the database
[connection string](#connectionstrings).  The connection string is
commonly of the format `hostname/servicename`, using the hostname
where the database is running and the Oracle Database service name of
the database instance.

Substitute your username, password and connection string in the code.
For downloaded examples, put these in [`dbconfig.js`][89].

Run the script, for example:

```
node myscript.js
```

#### Example: Simple SELECT statement in Node.js with Callbacks

```javascript
// myscript.js

var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err.message);
      return;
    }
    connection.execute(
      `SELECT manager_id, department_id, department_name
       FROM departments
       WHERE manager_id = :id`,
      [103],  // bind value for :id
      function(err, result) {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err.message);
          doRelease(connection);
          return;
        }
        console.log(result.rows);
        doRelease(connection);
      });
  });

function doRelease(connection) {
  connection.close(
    function(err) {
      if (err)
        console.error(err.message);
    });
}
```

With Oracle's sample HR schema, the output is:

```
[ [ 103, 60, 'IT' ] ]
```

Scripts to create Oracle's sample schemas can be found at
[github.com/oracle/db-sample-schemas][4].

## <a name="errorobj"></a> 2. Errors

The last parameter of each method is a callback, unless
[Promises](#promiseoverview) are being used.  The first parameter of
the callback is an *Error* object that contains error information if
the call fails.  If the call succeeds, then the object is null.

When using Promises, the `catch()` callback's error object will
contain error information when the Promise chain fails.

If an invalid value is set for a property, then an error occurs.  The
same is true for invalid operations on read-only or write-only
properties.  If an unrecognized property name is used, it will be
ignored.

### <a name="properror"></a> 2.1 Error Properties

The *Error* object contains `errorNum`, `message` and `offset` properties.

#### <a name="properrerrornum"></a> 2.1.1 `errorNum`

```
Number errorNum
```

The Oracle error number.  This value is undefined for non-Oracle
errors and for messages prefixed with NJS or DPI.

#### <a name="properrmessage"></a> 2.1.2 `message`

```
String message
```

The text of the error message.

The error may be a standard Oracle message with a prefix like ORA or
PLS.  Alternatively it may be a node-oracledb specific error prefixed with
NJS or DPI.

A single line error message may look like this:

```
ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
```

A multi-line error message may look like this:

```
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:
PLS-00201: identifier 'TESTPRC' must be declared
ORA-06550: line 1, column 7:
PL/SQL: Statement ignored
```

#### <a name="properroffset"></a> 2.1.3 `offset`

```
Number offset
```

The character offset into the SQL text that resulted in the Oracle
error.  The value may be `0` in non-SQL contexts.  This value is
undefined for non-Oracle errors and for messages prefixed with NJS or
DPI.

## <a name="oracledbclass"></a> 3. Oracledb Class

The *Oracledb* object is the factory class for *Pool* and *Connection* objects.

The *Oracledb* object is instantiated by loading node-oracledb:

```javascript
var oracledb = require("oracledb");
```

Internally, the add-on creates the *Oracledb* object as a singleton.
Reloading it in the same Node.js process creates a new pointer to the
same object.

### <a name="oracledbconstants"></a> 3.1 Oracledb Constants

These constants are defined in the `oracledb` module.  Usage is
described later in this document.

The numeric values for the constants are shown to aid debugging.  They

```

#### <a name="oracledbconstantsbinddir"></a> 3.1.4 Execute Bind Direction Constants

Constants for the `dir` property of `execute()`
[bindParams](#executebindParams), [`queryStream()`](#querystream) and
`executeMany()` [`bindDefs`](#executemanyoptbinddefs).

These specify whether data values bound to SQL or PL/SQL bind
parameters are passed into, or out from, the database:

```
oracledb.BIND_IN                // (3001) Direction for IN binds

oracledb.BIND_INOUT             // (3002) Direction for IN OUT binds

```

#### <a name="oracledbconstantsprivilege"></a> 3.1.5 Privileged Connection Constants

Constants for [`getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb)
[`privilege`](#getconnectiondbattrsprivilege) properties.

These specify what privilege should
be used by the connection that is being established.

```

```

### <a name="oracledbproperties"></a> 3.2 Oracledb Properties

The properties of the *Oracledb* object are used for setting up
configuration parameters for deployment.

If required, these properties can be overridden for the *Pool* or
*Connection* objects.

These properties may be read or modified. If a property is modified,
only subsequent invocations of the `createPool()` or `getConnection()`
methods will be affected. Objects that exist before a property is
modified are not altered.

Invalid values, or combinations of values, for pool configuration
properties can result in the error *ORA-24413: Invalid number of
sessions specified*.

Each of the configuration properties is described below.

#### <a name="propdbisautocommit"></a> 3.2.1 `oracledb.autoCommit`

```
Boolean autoCommit
```

If this property is *true*, then the transaction in the current
connection is automatically committed at the end of statement
execution.

The default value is *false*.

This property may be overridden in an [`execute()`](#executeoptions) call.

Note prior to node-oracledb 0.5 this property was called
`isAutoCommit`.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.autoCommit = false;
```

#### <a name="propdbconclass"></a> 3.2.2 `oracledb.connectionClass`

```
String connectionClass
```

The user-chosen Connection class value defines a logical name for connections.
Most single purpose applications should set `connectionClass` when
using a connection pool or DRCP.

When a pooled session has a connection class, Oracle ensures that the
session is not shared outside of that connection class.

The connection class value is similarly used by
[Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)](#drcp) to allow or
disallow sharing of sessions.

For example, where two different kinds of users share one pool, you
might set `connectionClass` to 'HRPOOL' for connections that access a
Human Resources system, and it might be set to 'OEPOOL' for users of an
Order Entry system.  Users will only be given sessions of the
appropriate class, allowing maximal reuse of resources in each case,
and preventing any session information leaking between the two systems.

If `connectionClass` is set for a non-pooled connection, the driver
name is not recorded in `V$` views.
See
[End-to-end Tracing, Mid-tier Authentication, and Auditing](#endtoend).

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.connectionClass = 'HRPOOL';
```

#### <a name="propdbedition"></a> 3.2.3 `oracledb.edition`

```
String edition
```

Sets the name used for Edition-Based Redefinition by connections.

See [Edition-Based Redefinition](#ebr) for more information.

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.edition = 'ed_2';
```

#### <a name="propdbevents"></a> 3.2.4 `oracledb.events`

```
Boolean events
```

Determines whether Oracle Client events mode should be enabled.

The default value for `events` is *false*.

This property can be overridden in the
[`oracledb.createPool()`](#createpoolpoolattrsevents) call and when
getting a standalone connection from
[`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondbattrsevents).

Events mode is required for [Fast Application Notification
(FAN)](#connectionfan) and [Runtime Load Balancing
(RLB)](#connectionrlb).

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.events = true;
```

#### <a name="propdbextendedmetadata"></a> 3.2.5 `oracledb.extendedMetaData`

```
Boolean extendedMetaData
```

Determines whether additional metadata is available for queries and
for REF CURSORs returned from PL/SQL blocks.

The default value for `extendedMetaData` is *false*. With this value,
the [`result.metaData`](#execmetadata)
[`result.resultSet.metaData`](#rsmetadata) objects only include column
names.

If `extendedMetaData` is *true* then `metaData` will contain
additional attributes.  These are listed in
[Result Object Properties](#execmetadata).

This property may be overridden in an [`execute()`](#executeoptions) call.

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.10.

#### <a name="propdbisexternalauth"></a> 3.2.6 `oracledb.externalAuth`

```
Boolean externalAuth
```

If this property is *true* then connections are established using
external authentication.  See [External Authentication](#extauth) for
more information.

The default value is *false*.

The `user` and `password` properties for connecting or creating a pool
should not be set when `externalAuth` is *true*.

This property can be overridden in the
[`oracledb.createPool()`](#createpool) call and when getting a
standalone connection from
[`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb).

Note prior to node-oracledb 0.5 this property was called
`isExternalAuth`.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.externalAuth = false;
```

#### <a name="propdbfetcharraysize"></a> 3.2.7 `oracledb.fetchArraySize`

```
Number fetchArraySize
```

This property sets the size of an internal buffer used for fetching
query rows from Oracle Database.  Changing it may affect query
performance but does not affect how many rows are returned to the
application.

The default value is 100.

The property is used during the default [direct
fetches](#fetchingrows), during ResultSet [`getRow()`](#getrow) calls,
and for [`queryStream()`](#querystream).  It is not used for
[`getRows()`](#getrows).

Increasing this value reduces the number of round-trips to the
database but increases memory usage for each data fetch.  For queries
that return a large number of rows, higher values of `fetchArraySize`
may give better performance.  For queries that only return a few rows,
reduce the value of `fetchArraySize` to minimize the amount of memory
management during data fetches.  JavaScript memory fragmentation may
occur in some cases, see [Fetching Rows with Direct
Fetches](#fetchingrows).

For direct fetches (those using `execute()` option [`resultSet:
false`](#propexecresultset)), the internal buffer size will be based
on the lesser of [`maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows) and `fetchArraySize`.

The property was introduced in node-oracledb version 2.0.  It replaces
[`prefetchRows`](#propdbprefetchrows).

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.fetchArraySize = 100;
```

#### <a name="propdbfetchasbuffer"></a> 3.2.8 `oracledb.fetchAsBuffer`

```
Array fetchAsBuffer
```

An array of node-oracledb types.  Currently the only valid type
is [`oracledb.BLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).  When a BLOB column is
queried with [`execute()`](#execute)
or [`queryStream()`](#querystream), the column data is returned as a
Buffer instead of the default representation.

By default in node-oracledb, all columns are returned as native types
or as [Lob](#lobclass) instances, in the case of CLOB and BLOB types.

Individual query columns in [`execute()`](#execute)
or [`queryStream()`](#querystream) calls can override the
`fetchAsBuffer` global setting by
using [`fetchInfo`](#executeoptions).

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.13.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.fetchAsBuffer = [ oracledb.BLOB ];
```

#### <a name="propdbfetchasstring"></a> 3.2.9 `oracledb.fetchAsString`

```
Array fetchAsString
```

An array of node-oracledb types.  The valid types are
[`oracledb.DATE`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype), [`oracledb.NUMBER`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype)
and [`oracledb.CLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).  When any column having one
of the specified types is queried with [`execute()`](#execute)
or [`queryStream()`](#querystream), the column data is returned as a
string instead of the default representation.

By default in node-oracledb, all columns are returned as native types
or as [Lob](#lobclass) instances, in the case of CLOB and BLOB types.

This property helps avoid situations where using JavaScript types can
lead to numeric precision loss, or where date conversion is unwanted.
See [Query Result Type Mapping](#typemap) for more discussion.

For non-CLOB types, the maximum length of a string created by this
mapping is 200 bytes.  Strings created for CLOB columns will generally
be limited by Node.js and V8 memory restrictions.

Individual query columns in [`execute()`](#execute)
or [`queryStream()`](#querystream) calls can override the
`fetchAsString` global setting by
using [`fetchInfo`](#executeoptions).

For non-CLOB types, the conversion to string is handled by Oracle
client libraries and is often referred to as *defining* the fetch
type.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.fetchAsString = [ oracledb.DATE, oracledb.NUMBER ];
```

#### <a name="propdblobprefetchsize"></a> 3.2.10 `oracledb.lobPrefetchSize`

```
Number lobPrefetchSize
```

This attribute is temporarily disabled.  Setting it has no effect.

Node-oracledb internally uses Oracle *LOB Locators* to manipulate long
object (LOB) data.  LOB Prefetching allows LOB data to be returned
early to node-oracledb when these locators are first returned.
This is similar to the way [row prefetching](#rowprefetching) allows
for efficient use of resources and round-trips between node-oracledb
and the database.

Prefetching of LOBs is mostly useful for small LOBs.

The default size is 16384.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.lobPrefetchSize = 16384;
```

#### <a name="propdbmaxrows"></a> 3.2.11 `oracledb.maxRows`

```
Number maxRows
```

The maximum number of rows that are fetched by a query with
[`connection.execute()`](#execute) when *not* using a
[ResultSet](#resultsetclass).  Rows beyond this limit are not fetched
from the database.  A value of 0 means there is no limit.

The default value is 0, meaning unlimited.

This property may be overridden in an [`execute()`](#executeoptions)
call.

To improve database efficiency, SQL queries should use a row limiting
clause like [OFFSET / FETCH](#pagingdata) or equivalent. The `maxRows`
property can be used to stop badly coded queries from returning
unexpectedly large numbers of rows.

When the number of query rows is relatively big, or can't be
predicted, it is recommended to use a [ResultSet](#resultsetclass) or
[`queryStream()`](#querystream).  This allows applications to process
rows in smaller chunks or individually, preventing the Node.js memory
limit being exceeded or query results being unexpectedly truncated by
a `maxRows` limit.

In version 1, the default value was 100.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.maxRows = 0;
```

#### <a name="propdboracleclientversion"></a> 3.2.12 `oracledb.oracleClientVersion`

```
readonly Number oracleClientVersion
```

This readonly property gives a numeric representation of the Oracle client library version which is useful in comparisons.
For version *a.b.c.d.e*, this property gives the number: `(100000000 * a) + (1000000 * b) + (10000 * c) + (100 * d) + e`

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.3.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
console.log("Oracle client library version number is " + oracledb.oracleClientVersion);
```

#### <a name="propdboracleclientversionstring"></a> 3.2.13 `oracledb.oracleClientVersionString`

```
readonly String oracleClientVersionString
```

This readonly property gives a string representation of the Oracle client library version which is useful for display.

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
console.log("Oracle client library version is " + oracledb.oracleClientVersionString);
```

#### <a name="propdboutformat"></a> 3.2.14 `oracledb.outFormat`

```
Number outFormat
```

The format of query rows fetched when
using [`connection.execute()`](#execute)
or [`connection.queryStream()`](#querystream).  It affects
both [ResultSet](#propexecresultset) and non-ResultSet queries.  It
can be used for top level queries and REF CURSOR output.

This can be either of
the [Oracledb constants](#oracledbconstantsoutformat) `oracledb.ARRAY` or
`oracledb.OBJECT`.  The default value is `oracledb.ARRAY` which is more efficient.

If specified as `oracledb.ARRAY`, each row is fetched as an array of column
values.

If specified as `oracledb.OBJECT`, each row is fetched as a JavaScript object.
The object has a property for each column name, with the property
value set to the respective column value.  The property name follows
Oracle's standard name-casing rules.  It will commonly be uppercase,
since most applications create tables using unquoted, case-insensitive
names.

This property may be overridden in
an [`execute()`](#executeoptions)
or [`queryStream()`](#querystream) call.

See [Query Output Formats](#queryoutputformats) for more information.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.outFormat = oracledb.ARRAY;
```

#### <a name="propdbpoolincrement"></a> 3.2.15 `oracledb.poolIncrement`

```
Number poolIncrement
```

The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection
request exceeds the number of currently open connections.

The default value is 1.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.poolIncrement = 1;
```

#### <a name="propdbpoolmax"></a> 3.2.16 `oracledb.poolMax`

```
Number poolMax
```

The maximum number of connections to which a connection pool can grow.

The default value is 4.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

See [Connections and Number of Threads](#numberofthreads) for why you
should not increase this value beyond 128.  Importantly, if you
increase `poolMax` you should also increase the number of threads
available to node-oracledb.

See [Connection Pooling](#connpooling) for other pool sizing guidelines.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.poolMax = 4;
```

#### <a name="propdbpoolmin"></a> 3.2.17 `oracledb.poolMin`

```
Number poolMin
```

The minimum number of connections a connection pool maintains, even
when there is no activity to the target database.

The default value is 0.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.poolMin = 0;
```

#### <a name="propdbpoolpinginterval"></a> 3.2.18 `oracledb.poolPingInterval`

```
Number poolPingInterval
```

When a pool [`getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) is called and the
connection has been idle in the pool for at least `poolPingInterval`
seconds, an internal "ping" will be performed first to check the
aliveness of the connection.  At the cost of some overhead for
infrequently accessed connection pools, connection pinging improves
the chance a pooled connection is valid when it is used because
identified un-unusable connections will not be returned to the
application by `getConnection()`.

Note when node-oracledb is using version 12.2 of the Oracle client
library, the value of `poolPingInterval` is ignored.  Oracle client
12.2 has a lightweight, always-enabled connection check that replaces
explicit pinging.

With Oracle client 12.1 or earlier, unless `poolPingInterval` is `0`,
it is possible for un-usable connections to be returned by a pool
`getConnection()` call.  Since it is also possible for network outages
to occur after `getConnection()` is called, applications should
implement appropriate statement execution error checking.

The default value is 60 seconds.  Possible values for `poolPingInterval` are:

`poolPingInterval` Value     | Behavior of a Pool `getConnection()` Call
----------|------------------------------------------
`n` < `0` | Never checks for connection aliveness
`n` = `0` | Always checks for connection aliveness. There is some overhead in performing a ping so non-zero values are recommended for most applications
`n` > `0` | Checks aliveness if the connection has been idle in the pool (not "checked out" to the application by `getConnection()`) for at least `n` seconds

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

See [Connection Pool Pinging](#connpoolpinging) for more discussion.

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.12.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.poolPingInterval = 60;     // seconds
```

#### <a name="propdbpooltimeout"></a> 3.2.19 `oracledb.poolTimeout`

```
Number poolTimeout
```

The number of seconds after which idle connections (unused in the
pool) are terminated.  Idle connections are terminated only when the
pool is accessed.  If the `poolTimeout` is set to 0, then idle
connections are never terminated.

The default value is 60.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.poolTimeout = 60;
```

#### <a name="propdbprefetchrows"></a> 3.2.20 `oracledb.prefetchRows`

```
Number prefetchRows
```

This attribute is no longer used in node-oracledb version 2 and has no
effect on applications.  Use
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) instead.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.prefetchRows = 100;
```

#### <a name="propdbpromise"></a> 3.2.21 `oracledb.Promise`

```
Promise Promise
```

Node-oracledb supports Promises on all methods.  The standard Promise
library is used.

See [Promises and node-oracledb](#promiseoverview) for a discussion of
using Promises.

This property can be set to override or disable the Promise
implementation.

##### Example

```javascript
var mylib = require('myfavpromiseimplementation');
oracledb.Promise = mylib;
```

Promises can be completely disabled by setting

```javascript
oracledb.Promise = null;
```

#### <a name="propdbqueuerequests"></a> 3.2.22 `oracledb.queueRequests`

```
Boolean queueRequests
```

If this property is *true* and the number of connections "checked out"
from the pool has reached the number specified by
[`poolMax`](#propdbpoolmax), then new requests for connections are
queued until in-use connections are released.

If this property is *false* and a request for a connection is made
from a pool where the number of "checked out" connections has reached
`poolMax`, then an *ORA-24418* error indicating that further sessions
cannot be opened will be returned.

The default value is *true*.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

See [Connection Pool Queue](#connpoolqueue) for more information.

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.7.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.queueRequests = false;
```

#### <a name="propdbqueuetimeout"></a> 3.2.23 `oracledb.queueTimeout`

```
Number queueTimeout
```

The number of milliseconds after which connection requests waiting in
the connection request queue are terminated.  If `queueTimeout` is
0, then queued connection requests are never terminated.

The default value is 60000.

This property may be overridden when [creating a connection pool](#createpool).

See [Connection Pool Queue](#connpoolqueue) for more information.

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.7.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.queueTimeout = 3000; // 3 seconds
```

#### <a name="propdbstmtcachesize"></a> 3.2.24 `oracledb.stmtCacheSize`

```
Number stmtCacheSize
```

The number of statements that are cached in the [statement cache](#stmtcache) of
each connection.

The default value is 30.

This property may be overridden for specific *Pool* or *Connection*
objects.

In general, set the statement cache to the size of the working set of
statements being executed by the application.  Statement caching can
be disabled by setting the size to 0.

See [Statement Caching](#stmtcache) for examples.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.stmtCacheSize = 30;
```

#### <a name="propdbversion"></a> 3.2.25 `oracledb.version`
```
readonly Number version
```

This readonly property gives a numeric representation of the node-oracledb version.
For version *x.y.z*, this property gives the number: `(10000 * x) + (100 * y) + z`

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
console.log("Driver version number is " + oracledb.version);
```

#### <a name="propdbversionstring"></a> 3.2.26 `oracledb.versionString`
```
readonly String versionString
```

This readonly property gives a string representation of the node-oracledb version, including the version suffix if one is present.

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.1.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
console.log("Driver version is " + oracledb.versionString);
```

#### <a name="propdbversionsuffix"></a> 3.2.27 `oracledb.versionSuffix`
```
readonly String versionSuffix
```

This readonly property gives a string representing the version suffix (e.g. "-dev" or "-beta") or an empty string if no version suffix is present.

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.1.

##### Example

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
console.log("Driver version suffix is " + oracledb.versionSuffix);
```

### <a name="oracledbmethods"></a> 3.3 Oracledb Methods

#### <a name="createpool"></a> 3.3.1 `oracledb.createPool()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
createPool(Object poolAttrs, function(Error error, Pool pool){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = createPool(Object poolAttrs);
```

##### Description

This method creates a pool of connections with the specified username,
password and connection string.

Internally, `createPool()` creates an [Oracle Call Interface Session
Pool][6] for each Pool object.

The default properties may be overridden by specifying new properties
in the `poolAttrs` parameter.

It is possible to add pools to the pool cache when calling `createPool()`.
This allows pools to later be accessed by name, removing the need to
pass the pool object through code.
See [Connection Pool Cache](#connpoolcache) for more details.

A pool should be terminated with the [`pool.close()`](#poolclose)
call, but only after all connections have been released.

See [Connection Pooling](#connpooling) for more information about pooling.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrs"></a> 3.3.1.1 `createPool()`: Parameters and Attributes

```
Object poolAttrs
```

The `poolAttrs` parameter object provides connection credentials and
pool-specific configuration properties, such as the maximum or minimum
number of connections for the pool, or the statement cache size for
the connections.

The properties provided in the `poolAttrs` parameter override the
default pooling properties of the *Oracledb* object.  If an attribute
is not set, or is null, the value of the related *Oracledb* property
will be used.

Note that the `poolAttrs` parameter may have configuration
properties that are not used by the `createPool()` method.  These are
ignored.

The properties of `poolAttrs` are described below.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrsconnectstring"></a> 3.3.1.1.1 `connectString`, `connectionString`

```
String connectString
String connectionString
```

The two properties are aliases for each other.  Use only one of the properties.

The Oracle database instance used by connections in the pool.  The
string can be an Easy Connect string, or a Net Service Name from a
`tnsnames.ora` file, or the name of a local Oracle database instance.
See [Connection Strings](#connectionstrings) for examples.

The alias `connectionString` was added in node-oracledb 2.1.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrsedition"></a> 3.3.1.1.2 `edition`

```

```

Sets the name used for [Edition-Based Redefinition](#ebr) by
connections in the pool.

This optional property overrides the
[`oracledb.edition`](#propdbedition) property.

This property was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrsevents"></a> 3.3.1.1.3 `events`

```
Boolean events
```

Indicate whether Oracle Call Interface events mode should be enabled for this pool.

```
Boolean externalAuth
```

Indicate whether pooled connections should be established using
[External Authentication](#extauth).

The default is *false*.

This optional property overrides the
[`oracledb.externalAuth`](#propdbisexternalauth) property.

The `user` and `password` properties should not be set when
`externalAuth` is *true*.

Note prior to node-oracledb 0.5 this property was called
`isExternalAuth`.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrspassword"></a> 3.3.1.1.5 `password`

```
String password
```

password is also necessary if a proxy user is specified.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrspoolalias"></a> 3.3.1.1.6 `poolAlias`

```
String poolAlias
```

The `poolAlias` is an optional property that is used to explicitly add pools to the
connection pool cache. If a pool alias is provided, then the new pool will be added
to the connection pool cache and the `poolAlias` value can then be used with methods
that utilize the connection pool cache, such as [`oracledb.getPool()`](#getpool) and
[`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb).

See [Connection Pool Cache](#connpoolcache) for details and examples.

This property was added in node-oracledb 1.11.

###### <a name="createpoolpoolattrspoolincrement"></a> 3.3.1.1.7 `poolIncrement`

```
Number poolIncrement
```

The number of connections that are opened whenever a connection
request exceeds the number of currently open connections.

```
Number poolPingInterval
```

When a pool [`getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) is called and the
connection has been idle in the pool for at least `poolPingInterval`
seconds, an internal "ping" will be performed first to check the
aliveness of the connection.

Note this attribute is ignored when node-oracledb is using version
12.2 of the Oracle client library, since this has its own lightweight,
always-enabled connection check.

The default value is 60.

This optional property overrides the
[`oracledb.poolPingInterval`](#propdbpoolpinginterval) property.

String user
```

The database user name for connections in the pool.  Can be a simple
user name or a proxy of the form *alison[fred]*. See the [Client
Access Through a Proxy][7] section in the Oracle Call Interface manual
for more details about proxy authentication.

#### <a name="createpoolpoolcallback"></a> 3.3.1.2 `createPool()`: Callback Function

```
function(Error error, Pool pool)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `createPool()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).
*Pool pool*   | The newly created connection pool. If `createPool()` fails, `pool` will be NULL.  See [Pool class](#poolclass) for more information.

#### <a name="getconnectiondb"></a> 3.3.2 `oracledb.getConnection()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
getConnection([String poolAlias | Object connAttrs], function(Error error, Connection conn){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = getConnection([String poolAlias | Object connAttrs]);
```

##### Description

Obtains a connection from a pool in the [connection pool
cache](#connpoolcache) or creates a new, standalone, non-pooled
connection.

For situations where connections are used infrequently, creating a
standalone connection may be more efficient than creating and managing
a connection pool. However, in most cases, Oracle recommends getting
connections from a [connection pool](#createpool).

The following table shows the various signatures that can be used when invoking
`getConnection` and describes how the function will behave as a result.

Signature | Description
--------- | -----------
`oracledb.getConnection()` | Gets a connection from the previously created default pool.  Returns a promise.
`oracledb.getConnection(callback)` | Gets a connection from the previously created default pool.  Invokes the callback.
`oracledb.getConnection(poolAlias)` | Gets a connection from the previously created pool with the specified `poolAlias`.  Returns a promise.
`oracledb.getConnection(poolAlias, callback)` | Gets a connection from the previously created pool with the specified `poolAlias`.  Invokes the callback.
`oracledb.getConnection(connAttrs)` | Creates a standalone, non-pooled connection. Returns a promise.
`oracledb.getConnection(connAttrs, callback)` | Creates a standalone, non-pooled connection.  Invokes the callback.

See [Connection Handling](#connectionhandling) for more information on
connections.

Note if the application opens a number of connections, you should
increase the number of threads available to node-oracledb.
See [Connections and Number of Threads](#numberofthreads).

the connection is returned to the pool and is available for reuse.

Calling `close()` as soon as a connection is no longer required is
strongly encouraged.  Releasing early can improve system efficiency.
Calling `close()` for pooled connections is required to prevent the
pool running out of connections.

When a connection is released, any ongoing transaction on the
connection is rolled back.

After releasing a connection to a pool, there is no
guarantee a subsequent `getConnection()` call gets back the same
database connection.  The application must redo any ALTER SESSION
statements on the new connection object, as required.

If an error occurs on a pooled connection and that error is known to
make the connection unusable, then `close()` will drop that connection
from the connection pool.  So a future pooled `getConnection()` call
that grows the pool will create a new, valid connection.

This method was added to node-oracledb 1.9, replacing the equivalent
alias `connection.release()`.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `close()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).

####  <a name="commit"></a> 4.2.4 `connection.commit()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
commit(function(Error error){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = commit();
```

##### Description

This call commits the current transaction in progress on the connection.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `commit()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).

#### <a name="connectioncreatelob"></a> 4.2.5 `connection.createLob()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
createLob(Number type, function(Error error, Lob lob){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = createLob(Number type);
```

##### Description

Creates a [Lob](#lobclass) as an Oracle [temporary LOB][12].  The LOB
is initially empty.  Data can be streamed to the LOB, which can then
be passed into PL/SQL blocks, or inserted into the database.

When no longer required, Lobs created with `createLob()` should be
closed with [`lob.close()`](#lobclose) because Oracle Database
resources are held open if temporary LOBs are not closed.

Open temporary LOB usage can be monitored using the view
[`V$TEMPORARY_LOBS`][13].

LOBs created with `createLob()` can be bound for IN, IN OUT and OUT
binds.

See [Working with CLOB and BLOB Data](#lobhandling) and [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds) for more information.

##### Parameters

```
Number type
```

One of the constants [`oracledb.CLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype)
or [`oracledb.BLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `createLob()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).


#### <a name="execute"></a> 4.2.6 `connection.execute()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
execute(String sql, [Object bindParams, [Object options,]] function(Error error, [Object result]){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = execute(String sql, [Object bindParams, [Object options]]);
```

##### Description

This call executes a single SQL or PL/SQL statement.
See [SQL Execution](#sqlexecution) for examples.  Also
see [`queryStream()`](#querystream) for an alternative way of executing
queries.

The statement to be executed may contain [IN binds](#inbind),
[OUT or IN OUT](#outbind) bind values or variables, which are bound
using either an object or an array.

A callback function returns a [`result`](#executecallback) object,
containing any fetched rows, the values of any OUT and IN OUT bind
variables, and the number of rows affected by the execution of
[DML][14] statements.

##### Parameters


Parameter | Description
----------|------------
[`String sql`](#executesqlparam) | The SQL statement that is executed. The statement may contain bind parameters.
[`Object bindParams`](#executebindParams) | This function parameter is needed if there are bind parameters in the SQL statement.
[`Object options`](#executeoptions) | This is an optional parameter to `execute()` that may be used to control statement execution.
[`function(Error error, [Object result])`](#executecallback) | Callback function with the execution results.

The parameters are discussed in the next sections.

##### <a name="executesqlparam"></a> 4.2.6.1 `execute()`: SQL Statement

```
String sql
```

The SQL or PL/SQL statement that `execute()` executes. The statement
may contain bind variables.

##### <a name="executebindParams"></a> 4.2.6.2 `execute()`: Bind Parameters

```
Object bindParams
```

The `execute()` function `bindParams` parameter is needed if there are
bind variables in the statement, or if [`options`](#executeoptions)
are used.  It can be either an object that associates values or
JavaScript variables to the statement's bind variables by name, or an
array of values or JavaScript variables that associate to the
statement's bind variables by their relative positions.
See [Bind Parameters for Prepared Statements](#bind) for more details
on binding.

If a bind value is an object it may have the following properties:

Bind Property | Description
---------------|------------
`dir` | The direction of the bind.  One of the [Execute Bind Direction Constants](#oracledbconstantsbinddir) `oracledb.BIND_IN`, `oracledb.BIND_INOUT`, or `oracledb.BIND_OUT`. The default is `oracledb.BIND_IN`.
`maxArraySize` | The number of array elements to be allocated for a PL/SQL Collection INDEX BY associative array OUT or IN OUT array bind variable.  For IN binds, the value of `maxArraySize` is ignored.  See [PL/SQL Collection Associative Array (Index-by) Bind Parameters](plsqlindexbybinds).
`maxSize` | The maximum number of bytes that an OUT or IN OUT bind variable of type `oracledb.STRING` or `oracledb.BUFFER` can use to get data. The default value is 200. The maximum limit depends on the database type, see below.  When binding IN OUT, then `maxSize` refers to the size of the returned  value: the input value can be smaller or bigger.  For IN binds, `maxSize` is ignored.
`type` | The node-oracledb or JavaScript data type to be bound.  One of the [Node-oracledb Type Constants](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) `oracledb.BLOB`, `oracledb.BUFFER`, `oracledb.CLOB`, `oracledb.CURSOR`, `oracledb.DATE`, `oracledb.NUMBER`, or `oracledb.STRING`.  With IN or IN OUT binds the type can be explicitly set with `type` or it will default to the type of the input data value.  With OUT binds, the type defaults to `oracledb.STRING` whenever `type` is not specified.
`val` | The input value or variable to be used for an IN or IN OUT bind variable.

The limit for `maxSize` when binding as `oracledb.BUFFER` is 2000
bytes, and as `oracledb.STRING` is 4000 bytes unless you are using
Oracle Database 12c and the database initialization parameter
`MAX_STRING_SIZE` has a value of `EXTENDED`.  In this case the limit
is 32767 bytes.

When binding Oracle LOBs as `oracledb.STRING` or `oracledb.BUFFER`,
the value of `maxSize` can be much larger, see the limits
in [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds).

When binding to get a UROWID value from the database, note that
UROWIDs can take up to 5267 bytes when fetched from the database so
`maxSize` should be set to at least this value.

Note `oracledb.CURSOR` bind variables can be used only for PL/SQL OUT binds.

##### <a name="executeoptions"></a> 4.2.6.3 `execute()`: Options

```
Object options
```

This is an optional parameter to `execute()` that may be used to
control statement execution.

If there are no bind variables in the SQL statement, then a null
`bindParams`, for example `{}`, must be specified before `options`
otherwise you will get an error like *ORA-01036: Illegal variable
name/number* or *NJS-012: encountered invalid bind data type in parameter*.

The following properties can be set or overridden for the execution of
a statement.

###### <a name="propexecautocommit"></a> 4.2.6.3.1 `autoCommit`

```
Boolean autoCommit
```

Overrides [`oracledb.autoCommit`](#propdbisautocommit).

###### <a name="propexecextendedmetadata"></a> 4.2.6.3.2 `extendedMetaData`

```
Boolean extendedMetaData
```

Overrides [`oracledb.extendedMetaData`](#propdbextendedmetadata).

###### <a name="propexecfetcharraysize"></a> 4.2.6.3.3 `fetchArraySize`

```
Number fetchArraySize
```

Overrides [`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize).

###### <a name="propfetchinfo"></a> <a name="propexecfetchinfo"></a> 4.2.6.3.4 `fetchInfo`

```
Object fetchInfo
```

Object defining how query column data should be represented in
JavaScript.  It can be used in conjunction with, or instead of, the
global settings [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring)
and [`fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer).

The valid values for `type` are
[`oracledb.STRING`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype),
[`oracledb.BUFFER`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype)
and [`oracledb.DEFAULT`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).

The `fetchInfo` property `type` can be set to `oracledb.STRING` for number and
date columns in a query to indicate they should be returned as Strings
instead of their native format.  CLOB column data can also be returned
as Strings instead of [Lob](#lobclass) instances.

When `fetchInfo` is set to `oracledb.BUFFER` for a BLOB column, each BLOB item
will be returned as a Buffer instead of a [Lob](#lobclass) instance.

Using `oracledb.DEFAULT` overrides any global mapping given
by [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring)
or [`fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer).  The column data is
returned in native format.

For example:

```
fetchInfo:
{
  "HIRE_DATE":    { type : oracledb.STRING },  // return the date as a string
  "HIRE_DETAILS": { type : oracledb.DEFAULT }  // override fetchAsString or fetchAsBuffer
}
```

Each column is specified by name, using Oracle's standard naming
convention.

The maximum length of a string created by type mapping non-CLOB
columns is 200 bytes.  If a database column that is already being
fetched as type `oracledb.STRING` is specified in `fetchInfo`, then the actual
database metadata will be used to determine the maximum length.

Strings and Buffers created for LOB columns will generally be limited
by Node.js and V8 memory restrictions.

Columns fetched from REF CURSORS are not mapped by `fetchInfo`
settings in the `execute()` call.  Use the
global [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring)
or [`fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer) settings instead.

See [Query Result Type Mapping](#typemap) for more information on query type
mapping.

###### <a name="propexecmaxrows"></a> 4.2.6.3.5 `maxRows`

```
Number maxRows
```

Overrides [`oracledb.maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows).

###### <a name="propexecoutformat"></a> 4.2.6.3.6 `outFormat`

```
String outFormat
```

Overrides [`oracledb.outFormat`](#propdboutformat).

###### <a name="propexecprefetchrows"></a> 4.2.6.3.7 `prefetchRows`

```
Number prefetchRows
```

This attribute is no longer supported in node-oracledb version 2 and
has no effect on applications.  Use
[`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize) instead.

###### <a name="propexecresultset"></a> 4.2.6.3.8 `resultSet`

```
Boolean resultSet
```

Determines whether query results should be returned as a
[ResultSet](#resultsetclass) object or directly.  The default is
*false*.

##### <a name="executecallback"></a> 4.2.6.4 `execute()`: Callback Function

```
function(Error error, [Object result])
```

The parameters of the `execute()` callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `execute()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).
*Object result* | The [`result`](#resultobject) object, described below.  The `result` parameter can be omitted for [DDL][15] and [DML][14] statements where the application only checks `error` for success or failure.

##### <a name="resultobject"></a> Result Object Properties

The properties of `result` object from the `execute()` callback are described below.

###### <a name="execmetadata"></a> 4.2.6.4.1 `metaData`

```
readonly Array metaData
```

For `SELECT` statements, this contains an array of objects describing
details of columns for the select list.  For non queries, this property is undefined.

Each column's `name` is always given.  If the
[`oracledb.extendedMetaData`](#propdbextendedmetadata) or `execute()` option
[`extendedMetaData`](#propexecextendedmetadata) are *true* then
additional information is included.

- `name`: The column name follows Oracle's standard name-casing rules.  It will commonly be uppercase, since most applications create tables using unquoted, case-insensitive names.
- `fetchType`: one of the [Node-oracledb Type Constant](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) values.
- `dbType`: one of the [Oracle Database Type Constant](#oracledbconstantsdbtype) values.
- `byteSize`: the database byte size.  This is only set for `oracledb.DB_TYPE_VARCHAR`, `oracledb.DB_TYPE_CHAR` and `oracledb.DB_TYPE_RAW` column types.
- `precision`: set only for `oracledb.DB_TYPE_NUMBER`, `oracledb.DB_TYPE_TIMESTAMP`, `oracledb.DB_TYPE_TIMESTAMP_TZ` and `oracledb.DB_TYPE_TIMESTAMP_LTZ` columns.
- `scale`: set only for `oracledb.DB_TYPE_NUMBER` columns.
- `nullable`: indicates whether `NULL` values are permitted for this column.

For numeric columns: when `precision` is `0`, then the column is
simply a NUMBER.  If `precision` is nonzero and `scale` is `-127`,
then the column is a FLOAT.  Otherwise, it is a NUMBER(precision,
scale).

Metadata for ResultSets and REF CURSORS is available in a
[ResultSet property](#rsmetadata).  For Lobs, a
[Lob type property](#proplobtype) also indicates whether the object is
a BLOB or CLOB.

To get query metadata without fetching rows, use a
[ResultSet](#resultsetclass).  Access
[`resultset.metaData`](#rsmetadata) and then close the ResultSet.  Do
not call `getRow()` or `getRows()`.  Preferably use a query clause
such as `WHERE 1 = 0` so the database does minimal work.

See [Query Column Metadata](#querymeta) for examples.

###### <a name="execoutbinds"></a> 4.2.6.4.2 `outBinds`

```
Array/object outBinds
```

This contains the output values of OUT and IN OUT binds.
If [`bindParams`](#executebindParams) is passed as an array, then
`outBinds` is returned as an array.  If `bindParams` is passed as an
object, then `outBinds` is returned as an object.

###### <a name="execresultset"></a> 4.2.6.4.3 `resultSet`

```
Object resultSet
```

For `SELECT` statements when the [`resultSet`](#executeoptions) option
is *true*, use the `resultSet` object to fetch rows.
See [ResultSet Class](#resultsetclass)
and [Fetching Rows with Result Sets](#resultsethandling).

When using this option, [`resultSet.close()`](#close) must be called
when the ResultSet is no longer needed.  This is true whether or not
rows have been fetched from the ResultSet.

###### <a name="execrows"></a> 4.2.6.4.4 `rows`

```
Array rows
```

For `SELECT` statements using [direct fetches](#fetchingrows), `rows`
contains an array of fetched rows.  It will be NULL if there is an
error or the SQL statement was not a SELECT statement.  By default,
the rows are in an array of column value arrays, but this can be
changed to arrays of objects by setting
[`outFormat`](#propdboutformat) to `oracledb.OBJECT`.  If a single row
is fetched, then `rows` is an array that contains one single row.

The number of rows returned is limited by
[`oracledb.maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows) or the
[`maxRows`](#propexecmaxrows) option in an `execute()` call.  If
`maxRows` is 0, then the number of rows is limited by Node.js memory
constraints.

###### <a name="execrowsaffected"></a> 4.2.6.4.5 `rowsAffected`

```
Number rowsAffected
```

For [DML][14] statements (including SELECT FOR UPDATE) this contains
the number of rows affected, for example the number of rows
inserted. For non-DML statements such as queries, or if no rows are
affected, then `rowsAffected` will appear as undefined.

#### <a name="executemany"></a> 4.2.7 `connection.executeMany()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
executeMany(String sql, Array binds, [Object options], function(Error error, [Object result]) {});
```
Promise:
```
promise = executeMany(String sql, Array binds, [Object options]);
```

##### Description

This method allows sets of data values to be bound to one DML or
PL/SQL statement for execution.  It is like calling
[`connection.execute()`](#execute) multiple times but requires fewer
round-trips.  This is an efficient way to handle batch changes, for
example when inserting or updating multiple rows.  The method cannot
be used for queries.

The `executeMany()` method supports IN, IN OUT and OUT binds for most
data types except [PL/SQL Collection Associative
Arrays](#plsqlindexbybinds).

See [Batch Statement Execution](#batchexecution) for more information.

This method was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### <a name="executemanysqlparam"></a> 4.2.6.1 `executeMany()`: SQL Statement

```
String sql
```

The SQL or PL/SQL statement that `executeMany()` executes.  The
statement should contain bind variable names.

##### <a name="executemanybinds"></a> 4.2.7.2 `executeMany()`: Binds

The `binds` parameter contains the values or variables to be bound to
the executed statement.  It must be an array of arrays (for 'bind by
position') or an array of objects whose keys match the bind variable
names in the SQL statement (for 'bind by name').  Each sub-array or
sub-object should contain values for the bind variables used in the
SQL statement.  At least one such record must be specified.

If a record contains fewer values than expected, NULL values will be
used.  For bind by position, empty values can be specified using
syntax like `[a,,c,d]`.

By default, the direction of binds is `oracledb.BIND_IN`.  The first
data record determines the number of bind variables, each bind
variable's data type, and its name (when binding by name).  If a
variable in the first record contains a null, this value is ignored
and a subsequent record is used to determine that variable's
characteristics.  If all values in all records for a particular bind
variable are null, the type of that bind is `oracledb.STRING` with a
maximum size of 1.

The maximum sizes of strings and buffers are determined by scanning
all records in the bind data.

If a [`bindDefs`](#executemanyoptbinddefs) property is used, no data
scanning occurs.  This property explicitly specifies the
characteristics of each bind variable.

##### <a name="executemanyoptions"></a> 4.2.7.3 `executeMany()`: Options

The `options` parameter is optional.  It can contain the following
properties.

###### <a name="executemanyoptautocommit"></a> 4.2.7.3.1 `autoCommit`

```
Boolean autoCommit
```

This optional property overrides
[`oracledb.autoCommit`](#propdbisautocommit).

Note [`batchErrors`](#executemanyoptbatcherrors) can affect autocommit
mode.

###### <a name="executemanyoptbatcherrors"></a> 4.2.7.3.2 `batchErrors`

```
Boolean batchErrors
```

This optional property allows invalid data records to be rejected
while still letting valid data be processed.  It can only be set
*true* for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE statements.

When *false*, the `executeMany()` call will stop when the first error
occurs.  The callback [error object](#errorobj) will be set.

When `batchErrors` is *true*, processing will continue even if there
are data errors.  The `executeMany()` callback error parameter is not
set.  Instead, an array containing each error will be returned in the
callback `result` parameter.  All valid data records will be processed
and a transaction will be started but not committed, even if
`autoCommit` is *true*.  The application can examine the errors, take
action, and explicitly commit or rollback as desired.

Note that some classes of error will always return via the
`executeMany()` callback error object, not as batch errors.  No
transaction is created in this case.

The default value is *false*.

###### <a name="executemanyoptbinddefs"></a> 4.2.7.3.3 `bindDefs`

```
Object bindDefs
```

The `bindDefs` object defines the bind variable types, sizes and
directions.  This object is optional in some cases but it is more
efficient to set it.

It should be an array or an object, depending on the structure of the
[`binds parameter`](#executemanybinds).

Each value in the `bindDefs` array or object should be an object
containing the keys `dir`, `maxSize`, and `type` for each bind
variable, similar to how [`execute() bind
parameters`](#executebindParams) are identified.

BindDef Property | Description
---------------|------------
`dir` | The direction of the bind.  One of the [Execute Bind Direction Constants](#oracledbconstantsbinddir) `oracledb.BIND_IN`, `oracledb.BIND_INOUT`  or `oracledb.BIND_OUT`.  The default is `oracledb.BIND_IN`.
`maxSize` | Required for Strings and Buffers.  Ignored for other types.  Specifies the maximum number of bytes allocated when processing each value of this bind variable.  When data is being passed into the database, `maxSize` should be at least the size of the longest value.  When data is being returned from the database, `maxSize` should be the size of the longest value.  If `maxSize` is too small, `executeMany()` will throw an error that is not handled by [`batchErrors`](#executemanyoptbatcherrors).
`type` | The node-oracledb or JavaScript data type to be bound.  One of the [Node-oracledb Type Constants](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) `oracledb.BLOB`, `oracledb.BUFFER`, `oracledb.CLOB`, `oracledb.CURSOR`, `oracledb.DATE`, `oracledb.NUMBER`, or `oracledb.STRING`.

###### <a name="executemanyoptdmlrowcounts"></a> 4.2.7.3.4 `dmlRowCounts`

```
Boolean dmlRowCounts
```

When *true*, this optional property enables output of the number of
rows affected by each input data record.  It can only be set *true*
for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE statements.

The default value is *false*.

This feature works when node-oracledb is using version 12, or later,
of the Oracle client library.

##### <a name="executemanycallback"></a> 4.2.7.4 `executeMany()`: Callback Function

###### <a name="execmanybatcherrors"></a> 4.2.7.4.1 `batchErrors`

```
Array batchErrors
```

This property is an array of [error objects](#errorobj) that were
reported during execution.  The `offset` property of each error object
corresponds to the 0-based index of the `executeMany()` [binds
parameter](#executemanybinds) array, indicating which record could not
be processed.

It will be present only if [`batchErrors`](#executemanyoptbatcherrors)
was *true* in the [`executeMany()` options](#executemanyoptions)
parameter and there are data errors to report.  Some classes of
execution error will always return via the `executeMany()` callback
error object, not in `batchErrors`.

###### <a name="execmanydmlrowscounts"></a> 4.2.7.4.2 `dmlRowCounts`

```
Array dmlRowCounts
```

This is an array of integers identifying the number of rows affected
by each record of the [binds parameter](#executemanybinds). It is
present only if [`dmlRowCounts`](#executemanyoptdmlrowcounts) was
*true* in the [`executeMany()` options](#executemanyoptions) parameter
and a DML statement was executed.

###### <a name="execmanyoutbinds"></a> 4.2.7.4.3 `outBinds`

```
Object outBinds
```

This contains the value of any returned IN OUT or OUT binds.  It is an
array of arrays, or an array of objects, depending on the [`binds
parameters`](#executemanybinds) structure.  The length of the array
will correspond to the length of the array passed as the [binds
parameter](#executemanybinds).  It will be present only if there is at
least one OUT bind variable identified.

###### <a name="execmanyrowsaffected"></a> 4.2.7.4.4 `rowsAffected`

```
Number rowsAffected
```

This is an integer identifying the total number of database rows
affected by the processing of all records of the [binds
parameter](#executemanybinds).  It is only present if a DML statement
was executed.

#### <a name="getstmtinfo"></a> 4.2.8 `connection.getStatementInfo()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
getStatementInfo(String sql, function(Error error, [Object information]){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = getStatementInfo(String sql);
```

##### Description

Parses a SQL statement and returns information about it.  This is most
useful for finding column names of queries, and for finding the names
of bind variables used.

This method performs a round-trip to the database, so unnecessary
calls should be avoided.

The information is provided by lower level APIs that have some
limitations.  Some uncommon statements will return the statement type
as `oracledb.STMT_TYPE_UNKNOWN`.  DDL statements are not parsed, so
syntax errors in them will not be reported.  The direction and types
of bind variables cannot be determined.

This method was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### Parameters

```
String sql
```

The SQL statement to parse.

```
function(Error error, [Object information])
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `getStatementInfo()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).
*Object information* | The `information` object, described below.

Depending on the statement type, the `information` object may contain:

- `bindNames`: an array of strings corresponding to the unique names
  of the bind variables used in the SQL statement.

- `metaData`: containing properties equivalent to those given by
  `execute()` [extendedMetaData](#execmetadata).  This property exists
  only for queries.

- `statementType`: an integer corresponding to one of the [SQL
  Statement Type Constants](#oracledbconstantsstmttype).


#### <a name="connectionping"></a> 4.2.9 `connection.ping()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
ping(function(Error error){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = ping();
```

##### Description

This method checks that a connection is currently usable and the
network to the database is valid.  This call can be useful for system
health checks.  A ping only confirms that a single connection is
usable at the time of the ping.

Pinging doesn't replace error checking during statement execution,
since network or database failure may occur in the interval between
`ping()` and `execute()` calls.

Pinging requires a round-trip to the database so unnecessary ping
calls should be avoided.

If `ping()` returns an error, the application should close the
connection.

This method was added in node-oracledb 2.2.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `ping()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).

#### <a name="querystream"></a> 4.2.10 `connection.queryStream()`

##### Prototype

```
queryStream(String sql, [Object bindParams, [Object options]]);
```

##### Return Value

This method will return a [Readable Stream][16] for queries.

##### Description

This function provides query streaming support.  The parameters are
the same as [`execute()`](#execute) except a callback is not used.
Instead this function returns a stream used to fetch data.

Each row is returned as a `data` event.  Query metadata is available
via a `metadata` event.  The `end` event indicates the end of the
query results.

The connection must remain open until the stream is completely read.

For tuning, adjust the value of
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) or the `execute()`
option [`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize).

See [Query Streaming](#streamingresults) for more information.

Support for Node.js version 8 Stream `destroy()` method was added in

```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `rollback()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).

## <a name="lobclass"></a> 5. Lob Class

Lob objects can be used to access Oracle Database CLOB and BLOB data.

A Lob object implements the [Node.js Stream][16] interface.

See [Working with CLOB and BLOB Data](#lobhandling) and [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds) for more information.

### <a name="lobproperties"></a> 5.1 Lob Properties

The properties of a Lob object are listed below.

#### <a name="proplobchunksize"></a> 5.1.1 `lob.chunkSize`

```
readonly Number chunkSize
```

This corresponds to the size used by the Oracle LOB layer when
accessing or modifying the LOB value.

#### <a name="proploblength"></a> 5.1.2 `lob.length`

```
readonly Number length
```

Length of a queried LOB in bytes (for BLOBs) or characters (for CLOBs).

#### <a name="proplobpiecesize"></a> 5.1.3 `lob.pieceSize`

```
Number pieceSize
```

The number of bytes (for BLOBs) or characters (for CLOBs) to read for
each Stream 'data' event of a queried LOB.

The default value is [`chunkSize`](#proplobchunksize).

For efficiency, it is recommended that `pieceSize` be a multiple of
`chunkSize`.

The property should not be reset in the middle of streaming since data
will be lost when internal buffers are resized.

The maximum value for `pieceSize` is limited to the value of UINT_MAX.

#### <a name="proplobtype"></a> 5.1.4 `lob.type`

```
readonly Number type
```

This read-only attribute shows the type of Lob being used.  It will
have the value of one of the constants
[`oracledb.BLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) or
[`oracledb.CLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).  The value is derived from the
bind type when using LOB bind variables, or from the column type when
a LOB is returned by a query.

### <a name="lobmethods"></a> 5.2 Lob Methods

#### <a name="lobclose"></a> 5.2.1 `lob.close()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
close(function(Error error){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = close();
```

##### Description

Explicitly closes a Lob.

Lobs created with [`createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob) should be
explicitly closed with [`lob.close()`](#lobclose) when no longer
needed.  This frees resources in node-oracledb and in Oracle Database.

Persistent or temporary Lobs returned from the database may also be
closed with `lob.close()` as long as streaming is not currently
happening.  Note these Lobs are automatically closed when streamed to
completion or used as the source for an IN OUT bind.  If you try to
close a Lob being used for streaming you will get the error *NJS-023:
concurrent operations on a Lob are not allowed*.

The `lob.close()` method emits the [Node.js Stream][16] 'close' event
unless the Lob has already been explicitly or automatically closed.

The connection must be open when calling `lob.close()` on a temporary
LOB, such as those created by `createLob()`.

Once a Lob is closed, it cannot be bound.

See [Closing Lobs](#closinglobs) for more discussion.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `close()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).

## <a name="poolclass"></a> 6. Pool Class

A connection *Pool* object is created by calling the
[`oracledb.createPool()`](#createpool) method.

The *Pool* object obtains connections to the Oracle database using the
`getConnection()` method to "check them out" from the pool. Internally
[Oracle Call Interface Session Pooling][6] is used.

After the application finishes using a connection pool, it should
release all connections and terminate the connection pool by calling
the `close()` method on the Pool object.

See [Connection Pooling](#connpooling) for more information.

#### <a name="proppoolpoolmax"></a> 6.1.5 `pool.poolMax`

```
readonly Number poolMax
```

The maximum number of connections that can be open in the connection
pool.

See [`oracledb.poolMax`](#propdbpoolmax).

#### <a name="proppoolpoolmin"></a> 6.1.6 `pool.poolMin`

```
readonly Number poolMin
```

The minimum number of connections a connection pool maintains, even
when there is no activity to the target database.

See [`oracledb.poolMin`](#propdbpoolmin).

#### <a name="proppoolpoolpinginterval"></a> 6.1.7 `pool.poolPingInterval`

```
readonly Number poolPingInterval
```

The maximum number of seconds that a connection can remain idle in a
connection pool (not "checked out" to the application by
`getConnection()`) before node-oracledb pings the database prior to
returning that connection to the application.

See [`oracledb.poolPingInterval`](#propdbpoolpinginterval).

#### <a name="proppoolpooltimeout"></a> 6.1.8 `pool.poolTimeout`

```
readonly Number poolTimeout
```

The time (in seconds) after which the pool terminates idle connections
(unused in the pool). The number of connections does not drop below
poolMin.

See [`oracledb.poolTimeout`](#propdbpooltimeout).

#### <a name="proppoolqueuerequests"></a> 6.1.9 `pool.queueRequests`

```
readonly Boolean queueRequests
```

Determines whether requests for connections from the pool are queued
when the number of connections "checked out" from the pool has reached
the maximum number specified by [`poolMax`](#propdbpoolmax).

See [`oracledb.queueRequests`](#propdbqueuerequests).

#### <a name="proppoolqueueTimeout"></a> 6.1.10 `pool.queueTimeout`

```
readonly Number queueTimeout
```

The time (in milliseconds) that a connection request should wait in
the queue before the request is terminated.

See [`oracledb.queueTimeout`](#propdbqueuetimeout).

#### <a name="proppoolstmtcachesize"></a> 6.1.11 `pool.stmtCacheSize`

```
readonly Number stmtCacheSize
```

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
close(function(Error error){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = close();
```

##### Description

This call terminates the connection pool.

Any open connections should be released with [`connection.close()`](#connectionclose)
before `pool.close()` is called.

If the pool is in the [connection pool cache](#connpoolcache) it will be removed from the cache.

This method was added to node-oracledb 1.9, replacing the equivalent
alias `pool.terminate()`.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `close()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).


#### <a name="getconnectionpool"></a> 6.2.2 `pool.getConnection()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
getConnection(function(Error error, Connection conn){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = getConnection();
```

##### Description

This method obtains a connection from the connection pool.

If a previously opened connection is available in the pool, that
connection is returned.  If all connections in the pool are in use, a
new connection is created and returned to the caller, as long as the
number of connections does not exceed the specified maximum for the
pool. If the pool is at its maximum limit, the `getConnection()` call
results in an error, such as *ORA-24418: Cannot open further sessions*.

See [Connection Handling](#connectionhandling) for more information on
connections.

##### Parameters

```
function(Error error, Connection conn)
```

The parameters of the callback function are:

Callback function parameter | Description
----------------------------|-------------
*Error error* | If `getConnection()` succeeds, `error` is NULL.  If an error occurs, then `error` contains the [error message](#errorobj).
*Connection connection* | The newly created connection.   If `getConnection()` fails, `connection` will be NULL.  See [Connection class](#connectionclass) for more details.

#### <a name="terminate"></a> 6.2.3 `pool.terminate()`

An alias for [pool.close()](#poolclose).

## <a name="resultsetclass"></a> 7. ResultSet Class

ResultSets allow query results to fetched from the database one at a
time, or in groups of rows.  They can also be converted to Readable
Streams.  ResultSets enable applications to process very large data
sets.

ResultSets should also be used where the number of query rows cannot
be predicted and may be larger than Node.js can handle in a single
array.

A *ResultSet* object is obtained by setting `resultSet: true` in the
`options` parameter of the *Connection* [`execute()`](#execute) method
when executing a query.  A *ResultSet* is also returned to
node-oracledb when binding as type [`oracledb.CURSOR`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) to a
PL/SQL REF CURSOR bind parameter.

See [Fetching Rows with Result Sets](#resultsethandling) for more information on ResultSets.

### <a name="resultsetproperties"></a> 7.1 ResultSet Properties

The properties of a *ResultSet* object are listed below.

#### <a name="rsmetadata"></a> 7.1.1 `resultset.metaData`

```
readonly Array metaData
```

Contains an array of objects with metadata about the query or REF
CURSOR columns.

Each column's `name` is always given.  If the
[`oracledb.extendedMetaData`](#propdbextendedmetadata) or `execute()` option
[`extendedMetaData`](#propexecextendedmetadata) are *true* then
additional information is included.

See [`result.metaData`](#execmetadata) for the available attributes.

### <a name="resultsetmethods"></a> 7.2 ResultSet Methods

#### <a name="close"></a> 7.2.1 `resultset.close()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
close(function(Error error){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = close();
```

##### Description

Closes a ResultSet.  Applications should always call this at the end
of fetch or when no more rows are needed.  It should also be called if
no rows are ever going to be fetched from the ResultSet.

#### <a name="getrow"></a> 7.2.2 `resultset.getRow()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
getRow(function(Error error, Object row){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = getRow();
```

##### Description

This call fetches one row of the ResultSet as an object or an array of
column values, depending on the value of
[outFormat](#propdboutformat).

At the end of fetching, the ResultSet should be freed by calling
[`close()`](#close).

Performance of `getRow()` can be tuned by adjusting the value of
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) or the `execute()`
option [`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize).

#### <a name="getrows"></a> 7.2.3 `resultset.getRows()`

##### Prototype

Callback:
```
getRows(Number numRows, function(Error error, Array rows){});
```
Promise:
```
promise = getRows(Number numRows);
```

##### Description

This call fetches `numRows` rows of the ResultSet as an object or an
array of column values, depending on the value of [outFormat](#propdboutformat).

At the end of fetching, the ResultSet should be freed by calling [`close()`](#close).

Different values of `numRows` may alter the time needed for fetching
data from Oracle Database.  The value of
[`fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) has no effect on `getRows()`
performance or internal buffering.

#### <a name="toquerystream"></a> 7.2.4 `resultset.toQueryStream()`

##### Prototype

```
toQueryStream();
```

##### Return Value

This method will return a [Readable Stream][16].

##### Description

This synchronous method converts a ResultSet into a stream.

It can be used to make ResultSets from top-level queries or from REF
CURSOR bind variables streamable.  To make top-level queries
streamable, the alternative [`connection.queryStream()`](#querystream)
method may be easier to use.

To change the behavior of `toQueryStream()`, such as setting the
[query output Format](#queryoutputformats) or the internal buffer size
for performance, adjust global attributes such as
[`oracledb.outFormat`](#propdboutformat) and
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) before calling
[`execute()`](#execute).

See [Query Streaming](#streamingresults) for more information.

The `toQueryStream()` method was added in node-oracledb 1.9.  Support
for Node.js version 8 Stream `destroy()` method was added in node-oracledb 2.1.

## <a name="usermanual"></a> NODE-ORACLEDB USER MANUAL

## <a name="connectionhandling"></a> 8. Connection Handling

In applications which use connections infrequently, create a
connection with [`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb).
Connections should be released with
[`connection.close()`](#connectionclose) when no longer needed:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }

    . . .  // use connection

    connection.close(
      function(err) {
        if (err) { console.error(err.message); }
      });
  });
```

Applications which are heavy users of connections should create and
use a [Connection Pool](#connpooling).

### <a name="connectionstrings"></a> 8.1 Connection Strings

The `connectString` parameter for
[`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb) and
[`pool.getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) can be an [Easy
Connect](#easyconnect) string, or a Net Service Name from a local
[`tnsnames.ora`](#tnsnames) file or external naming service, or it can
be the SID of a local Oracle database instance.

The `connectionString` property is an alias for `connectString`.
Use only one of the properties.

If a connect string is not specified, the empty string "" is used
which indicates to connect to the local, default database.

#### <a name="easyconnect"></a> 8.1.1 Easy Connect Syntax for Connection Strings

An Easy Connect string is often the simplest to use.  With Oracle Database 12c
the syntax is:

```
[//]host_name[:port][/service_name][:server_type][/instance_name]
```

Note that old-school connection SIDs are not supported: only service names can be used.

For example, use *"localhost/XE"* to connect to the database *XE* on the local machine:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  . . .
```

For more information on Easy Connect strings see [Understanding the
Easy Connect Naming Method][17] in the Oracle documentation.

#### <a name="tnsnames"></a> 8.1.2 Net Service Names for Connection Strings

A Net Service Name, such as `sales` in the example below, can be used
to connect:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "sales"
  },
  . . .
```

This could be defined in a directory server, or in a local
`tnsnames.ora` file, for example:

```
sales =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = mymachine.example.com)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

Some older databases may use a 'SID' instead of a 'Service Name'.  A
connection string for these databases could look like:

```
sales =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = mymachine.example.com)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SID = orcl)
    )
  )
```

See [Optional Client Configuration Files](#tnsadmin) for where
`tnsnames.ora` files can be located.

For more information on `tnsnames.ora` files and contents see [General
Syntax of tnsnames.ora][18] in the Oracle documentation.

#### <a name="embedtns"></a> 8.1.3 Embedded Connection Strings

Full connection strings can be embedded in applications:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=mymachine.example.com)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=orcl)))"
  },
  . . .
```

#### <a name="notjdbc"></a> 8.1.4 JDBC and Node-oracledb Connection Strings Compared

Developers familiar with Java connection strings that reference a
service name like:

```
jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port/service_name
```

can use Oracle's Easy Connect syntax in node-oracledb:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "hostname:port/service_name"
  },
  . . .
```

Alternatively, if a JDBC connection string uses an old-style
[SID][19], and there is no service name available:

```
jdbc:oracle:thin:@hostname:port:sid
```

then consider creating a [`tnsnames.ora`](#tnsnames) entry, for example:

```
finance =
 (DESCRIPTION =
   (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = hostname)(PORT = 1521))
   (CONNECT_DATA =
     (SID = ORCL)
   )
 )
```

This can be referenced in node-oracledb:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "finance"
  },
  . . .
```

### <a name="numberofthreads"></a> 8.2 Connections and Number of Threads

If you open more than four connections, such as via
increasing [`poolMax`](#proppoolpoolmax), you should increase the
number of worker threads available to node-oracledb.  The thread pool
size should be at least equal to the maximum number of connections.
If the application does database and non-database work concurrently,
extra threads could also be required for optimal throughput.

Increase the thread pool size by setting the environment variable
[UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE][20] before starting Node.  For example, in a
Linux terminal, the number of Node.js worker threads can be increased
to 10 by using the following command:

```
$ UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=10 node myapp.js
```

If the value is set inside the application with
`process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` ensure it is set prior to any
asynchronous call that uses the thread pool otherwise the default size
of 4 will still be used.

Note the '[libuv][21]' library used by Node.js limits the number of
threads to 128.  This implies the maxiumum number of connections
opened, i.e. `poolMax`, should be less than 128.

Connections can handle one database operation at a time.  Node.js
worker threads executing database statements on a connection will wait
until round-trips between node-oracledb and the database are complete.
When an application handles a sustained number of user requests, and
database operations take some time to execute or the network is slow,
then all available threads may be held in use.  This prevents other
connections from beginning work and stops Node.js from handling more
user load.  Increasing the number of worker threads may improve
throughput and prevent [deadlocks][22].

As well as correctly setting the thread pool size, structure your code
to avoid starting parallel operations on a connection.  For example,
instead of using `async.parallel` or `async.each()` which call each
of their items in parallel, use `async.series` or `async.eachSeries()`.
When you use parallel calls on a connection, the queuing ends up being
done in the C layer via a mutex.  However libuv isn't aware that a
connection can only do one thing at a time - it only knows when it has
background threads available and so it sends off the work to be done.
If your application runs operations in parallel on a connection, you
could use more than one background thread (perhaps all of them) and
each could be waiting on the one before it to finish its "execute". Of
course other users or transactions can't use the threads at
that time either.  When you use methods like `async.series` or
`async.eachSeries()`, the queuing is instead done in the main
JavaScript thread.

### <a name="connpooling"></a> 8.3 Connection Pooling

When applications use a lot of connections for short periods, Oracle
recommends using a connection pool for efficiency.  Each pool can
contain one or more connections.  A pool can grow or shrink, as
needed.  Each node-oracledb process can use one or more local pools of
connections.

Pool expansion happens when the following are all true:
(i) [`getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) is called and (ii) all the
currently established connections in the pool are "checked out" by
previous `getConnection()` calls and are in-use by the application,
and (iii) the number of those connections is less than the pool's
`poolMax` setting.

A pool is created by calling the
[`oracledb.createPool()`](#createpool) method. Internally [Oracle Call
Interface Session Pooling][6] is used.

A connection is returned with the
[`pool.getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) function:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.createPool (
  {
    user          : "hr"
    password      : "welcome"
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, pool) {
    pool.getConnection (
      function(err, connection) {
      . . .  // use connection
      });
  });
```

Connections should be released with [`connection.close()`](#connectionclose) when no
longer needed:

```javascript
    connection.close(
      function(err) {
        if (err) { console.error(err.message); }
      });
```

Make sure to release connections in all codes paths, include error
handlers.

After an application finishes using a connection pool, it should
release all connections and terminate the connection pool by calling
the [`pool.close()`](#poolclose) method.

The growth characteristics of a connection pool are determined by the
Pool attributes [`poolIncrement`](#proppoolpoolincrement),
[`poolMax`](#proppoolpoolmax), [`poolMin`](#proppoolpoolmin) and
[`poolTimeout`](#proppoolpooltimeout).  Note that when External
Authentication is used, the pool behavior is different, see
[External Authentication](#extauth).

The Oracle Real-World Performance Group's general recommendation for
client connection pools is for the minimum and maximum number of
connections to be the same.  This avoids connection storms which can
decrease throughput.  They also recommend sizing connection pools so
that the sum of all connections from all applications accessing a
database gives 1-10 connections per database server CPU core.  See
[About Optimizing Real-World Performance with Static Connection
Pools][23].

The Pool attribute [`stmtCacheSize`](#propconnstmtcachesize) can be
used to set the statement cache size used by connections in the pool,
see [Statement Caching](#stmtcache).

#### <a name="connpoolcache"></a> 8.3.1 Connection Pool Cache

Node-oracledb has an internal connection pool cache which can be used
to facilitate sharing pools across modules and simplify getting
connections.  At creation time, a pool can be given a named alias.
The alias can later be used to retrieve the related pool object for
use.

Methods that can affect or use the connection pool cache include:
- [oracledb.createPool()](#createpool) - can add a pool to the cache
- [oracledb.getPool()](#getpool) - retrieves a pool from the cache (synchronous)
- [oracledb.getConnection()](#getconnectiondb) - can use a pool in the cache to retrieve connections
- [pool.close()](#poolclose) - automatically removes the pool from the cache if needed

Pools are added to the cache if
a [`poolAlias`](#createpoolpoolattrspoolalias) property is provided in
the [`poolAttrs`](#createpoolpoolattrs) object when invoking
`oracledb.createPool()`.  There can be multiple pools in the cache if
each pool is created with a unique alias.

If a pool is created without providing a pool alias, and a pool with
an alias of 'default' is not in the cache already, this pool will be
cached using the alias 'default'.  This pool is used by default in
methods that utilize the connection pool cache.  If subsequent pools
are created without explicit aliases, they will be not stored in the
pool cache.

##### Examples using the default pool

Assuming the connection pool cache is empty, the following will create a new pool
and cache it using the pool alias 'default':
```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.createPool (
  {
    user: 'hr',
    password: 'welcome',
    connectString: 'localhost/XE'
  },
  function(err, pool) {
    console.log(pool.poolAlias); // 'default'
    . . . // use pool
  }
);
```

Note that `createPool()` is not synchronous.

Once cached, the default pool can be retrieved using [oracledb.getPool()](#getpool) without
passing the `poolAlias` parameter:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
var pool = oracledb.getPool();

pool.getConnection(function(err, conn) {
  . . . // Use connection from the pool and then release it
});
```

This specific sequence can be simplified by using the shortcut to
[oracledb.getConnection()](#getconnectiondb) that returns a connection
from a pool:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(function(err, conn) {
  . . . // Use connection from the previously created 'default' pool and then release it
});
```

##### Examples using multiple pools

If the application needs to use more than one pool at a time, unique pool aliases
can be used when creating the pools:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

var hrPoolPromise = oracledb.createPool({
  poolAlias: 'hrpool',
  users: 'hr',
  password: 'welcome',
  connectString: 'localhost/XE'
});

var shPoolPromise = oracledb.createPool({
  poolAlias: 'shpool',
  user: 'sh',
  password: 'welcome',
  connectString: 'localhost/XE'
});

Promise.all([hrPoolPromise, shPoolPromise])
  .then(function(pools) {
    console.log(pools[0].poolAlias); // 'hrpool'
    console.log(pools[1].poolAlias); // 'shpool'
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    . . . // handle error
  })
```

To use the methods or attributes of a pool in the cache, a pool can be retrieved
from the cache by passing its pool alias to [oracledb.getPool()](#getpool):

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
var pool = oracledb.getPool('hrpool'); // or 'shpool'

pool.getConnection(function(err, conn) {
  . . . // Use connection from the pool and then release it
});
```

The [oracledb.getConnection()](#getconnectiondb) shortcut can also be used with a pool alias:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection('hrpool', function(err, conn) { // or 'shpool'
  . . . // Use connection from the pool and then release it
});
```

#### <a name="connpoolqueue"></a> 8.3.2 Connection Pool Queue

If the application has called `getConnection()` so that all
connections in the pool are in use, and
further [`pool.getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) requests
(or [`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb) calls that use a
pool) are made, then each new request will be queued until an in-use
connection is released back to the pool
with [`connection.close()`](#connectionclose).  If `poolMax` has not
been reached, then connections can be satisfied and are not queued.

The pool queue can be disabled by setting the pool property
[`queueRequests`](#propdbqueuerequests) to *false*.  When the queue is
disabled, `getConnection()` requests to a pool that cannot immediately be
satisfied will return an error.

The amount of time that a queued request will wait for a free
connection can be configured with [queueTimeout](#propdbqueuetimeout).
When connections are timed out of the queue, they will return the
error *NJS-040: connection request timeout* to the application.

Internally the queue is implemented in node-oracledb's JavaScript top
level.  A queued connection request is dequeued and passed down to
node-oracledb's underlying C++ connection pool when an active
connection is [released](#connectionclose), and the number of
connections in use drops below the value of
[`poolMax`](#proppoolpoolmax).

#### <a name="connpoolmonitor"></a> 8.3.3 Connection Pool Monitoring and Throughput

Connection pool usage should be monitored to choose the appropriate
connection pool settings for your workload.

The Pool attributes [`connectionsInUse`](#proppoolconnectionsinuse)
and [`connectionsOpen`](#proppoolconnectionsopen) provide basic
information about an active pool.

When using a [pool queue](#propdbqueuerequests), further statistics
can be enabled by setting the [`createPool()`](#createpool)
`poolAttrs` parameter `_enableStats` to *true*.  Statistics
can be output to the console by calling the `pool._logStats()`
method.  The underscore prefixes indicate that these are private
attributes and methods.  **This interface may be altered or
enhanced in the future**.

To enable recording of queue statistics:

```javascript
oracledb.createPool (
  {
    queueRequests : true,   // default is true
    _enableStats  : true,   // default is false
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, pool) {
  . . .
```

The application can later, on some developer-chosen event, display the
current statistics to the console by calling:

```javascript
pool._logStats();
```

The current implementation of `_logStats()` displays pool queue
statistics, pool settings, and related environment variables.

##### Statistics

The statistics displayed by `_logStats()` in this release are:

Statistic                 | Description
--------------------------|-------------
total up time             | The number of milliseconds this pool has been running.
total connection requests | Number of `getConnection()` requests made by the application to this pool.
total requests enqueued   | Number of `getConnection()` requests that could not be immediately satisfied because every connection in this pool was already being used, and so they had to be queued waiting for the application to return an in-use connection to the pool.
total requests dequeued   | Number of `getConnection()` requests that were dequeued when a connection in this pool became available for use.
total requests failed     | Number of `getConnection()` requests that invoked the underlying C++ `getConnection()` callback with an error state. Does not include queue request timeout errors.
total request timeouts    | Number of queued `getConnection()` requests that were timed out after they had spent [queueTimeout](#propdbqueuetimeout) or longer in this pool's queue.
max queue length          | Maximum number of `getConnection()` requests that were ever waiting at one time.
sum of time in queue      | The sum of the time (milliseconds) that dequeued requests spent in the queue.
min time in queue         | The minimum time (milliseconds) that any dequeued request spent in the queue.
max time in queue         | The maximum time (milliseconds) that any dequeued request spent in the queue.
avg time in queue         | The average time (milliseconds) that dequeued requests spent in the queue.
pool connections in use   | The number of connections from this pool that `getConnection()` returned successfully to the application and have not yet been released back to the pool.
pool connections open     | The number of connections in this pool that have been established to the database.

Note that for efficiency, the minimum, maximum, average, and sum of
times in the queue are calculated when requests are removed from the
queue.  They do not take into account times for connection requests
still waiting in the queue.

##### Attribute Values

The `_logStats()` method also shows attribute values in effect for the pool:

Attribute                                   |
--------------------------------------------|
[`poolAlias`](#createpoolpoolattrspoolalias)|
[`queueRequests`](#propdbqueuerequests)     |
[`queueTimeout`](#propdbqueuetimeout)       |
[`poolMin`](#propdbpoolmin)                 |
[`poolMax`](#propdbpoolmax)                 |
[`poolIncrement`](#propdbpoolincrement)     |
[`poolTimeout`](#propdbpooltimeout)         |
[`poolPingInterval`](#propdbpoolpinginterval) |
[`stmtCacheSize`](#propdbstmtcachesize)     |

##### Related Environment Variables

One related environment variable is is shown by `_logStats()`:

Environment Variable                                 | Description
-----------------------------------------------------|-------------
[`process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`](#numberofthreads) | The number of worker threads for this process.  Note this shows the value of the variable, however if this variable was set after the thread pool starts, the thread pool will actually be the default size of 4.

#### <a name="connpoolpinging"></a> 8.3.4 Connection Pool Pinging

Node-oracledb can 'ping' connections returned from pooled
`getConnection()` calls to check for their aliveness.  The frequency
of pinging can be controlled with
the [`oracledb.poolPingInterval`](#propdbpoolpinginterval) property or
during [pool creation](#createpool).  The default ping interval is
`60` seconds.

Without pinging, when connections are idle in a connection pool, there
is the possibility that a network or database instance failure makes
those connections unusable.  A `getConnection()` call will happily
return a connection from the pool but an error will occur when the
application later uses the connection.

Note that explicit pinging is unnecessary and is not performed when
node-oracledb is using version 12.2 of the Oracle client library.
This has its own lightweight, always-enabled connection check.  It
will return a valid connection to the node-oracledb driver, which in
turn returns it via `getConnection()`.  The value of
`poolPingInterval` is ignored.

With Oracle client 12.1 and earlier, when a
pool [`getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) is called and the
connection has been idle in the pool (not "checked out" to the
application by `getConnection()`) for the specified `poolPingInterval`
then an internal "ping" will be performed first.  At the cost of some
overhead for infrequently accessed connection pools, connection
pinging improves the chance a pooled connection is valid when it is
first used because identified un-unusable connections will not be
returned to the application by `getConnection()`.  For active
applications that are getting and releasing connections rapidly, the
connections will generally not have been idle longer than
`poolPingInterval` so no pings will be performed and there will be no
overhead.

If a ping detects the connection is invalid, for example if the
network had disconnected, then node-oracledb internally drops the
unusable connection and obtains another from the pool.  This second
connection may also need a ping.  This ping-and-release process may be
repeated until:

- an existing connection that doesn't qualify for pinging is obtained. The `getConnection()` call returns this to the application.  Note it is not guaranteed to  be usable
- a new, usable connection is opened. This is returned to the application
- a number of unsuccessful attempts to find a valid connection have been made, after which an error is returned to the application

Applications should continue to do appropriate error checking when
using connections in case they have become invalid in the time since
`getConnection()` was called.  This error checking will also protect
against cases where there was a network outage but a connection was
idle in the pool for less than `poolPingInterval` seconds and so
`getConnection()` did not ping.

In all cases, when a bad connection is [released](#connectionclose)
back to the pool, the connection is automatically destroyed.  This
allows a valid connection to be opened by some subsequent
`getConnection()` call.

You can tune `poolPingInterval` to meet your quality of service
requirements.

Explicit pings on any connection can be performed at any time with
[`connection.ping()`](#connectionping).

### <a name="drcp"></a> 8.4 Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)

[Database Resident Connection Pooling][24] (DRCP) enables database
resource sharing for applications that run in multiple client
processes or run on multiple middle-tier application servers.  DRCP
reduces the overall number of connections that a database must handle.

DRCP is useful for applications which share the same database credentials, have
similar session settings (for example date format settings and PL/SQL
package state), and where the application gets a database connection,
works on it for a relatively short duration, and then releases it.

To use DRCP in node-oracledb:

1. The DRCP pool must be started in the database: `SQL> execute dbms_connection_pool.start_pool();`
2. The [`connectionClass`](#propdbconclass) should be set by the node-oracledb application.  If it is not set, the pooled server session memory will not be reused optimally, and the statistic views will record large values for `NUM_MISSES`.
3. The `pool.createPool()` or `oracledb.getConnection()` property `connectString` (or its alias `connectionString`) must specify to use a pooled server, either by the Easy Connect syntax like [`myhost/sales:POOLED`](#easyconnect), or by using a [`tnsnames.ora`](#tnsnames) alias for a connection that contains `(SERVER=POOLED)`.

For efficiency, it is recommended that DRCP connections should be used
with node-oracledb's local [connection pool](#poolclass).

The DRCP 'Purity' is SELF for DRCP connections.  This allows reuse of
both the pooled server process and session memory, giving maximum
benefit from DRCP.  See the Oracle documentation on [benefiting from
scalability][25].

The [Oracle DRCP documentation][24] has more details, including when
to use, and when not to use DRCP.

There are a number of Oracle Database `V$` views that can be used to
monitor DRCP.  These are discussed in the Oracle documentation and in
the Oracle white paper [PHP Scalability and High Availability][26].
This paper also gives more detail on configuring DRCP.

### <a name="extauth"></a> 8.5 External Authentication

External Authentication allows applications to use an external
password store (such as [Oracle Wallet][27]), the [Secure Socket
Layer][28] (SSL), or the [operating system][29] to validate user
access.  One of the benefits is that database credentials do not need
to be hard coded in the application.

To use external authentication, set the
[`oracledb.externalAuth`](#propdbisexternalauth) property to *true*.  This property can
also be set in the `connAttrs` or `poolAttrs` parameters of the
[`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb) or
[`oracledb.createPool()`](#createpool) calls, respectively.  The `user` and
`password` properties should not be set, or should be empty strings:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    externalAuth: true,
    connectString: "localhost/orclpdb"
  },
  . . .
```

When `externalAuth` is set, any subsequent connections obtained using
the [`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb) or
[`pool.getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) calls will use external
authentication.  Setting this property does not affect the operation
of existing connections or pools.

Using `externalAuth` in the `connAttrs` parameter of a
`pool.getConnection()` call is not possible.  The connections from a *Pool*
object are always obtained in the manner in which the pool was
initially created.

For pools created with external authentication, the number of
connections initially created is zero even if a larger value is
specified for [`poolMin`](#propdbpoolmin).  The pool increment is
always 1, regardless of the value of
[`poolIncrement`](#proppoolpoolincrement).  Once the number
of open connections exceeds `poolMin` and connections are idle for
more than the [`poolTimeout`](#propdbpooltimeout) seconds, then the
number of open connections does not fall below `poolMin`.

### <a name="privconn"></a> 8.6 Privileged Connections

Database privileges such as `SYSDBA` can be obtained when using
standalone connections.  Use one of the [Privileged Connection
Constants](#oracledbconstantsprivilege) with the connection
[`privilege`](#getconnectiondbattrsprivilege) property, for example:

```
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : 'sys',
    password      : 'secret',
    connectString : 'localhost/orclpdb',
    privilege     : oracledb.SYSDBA
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err)
      console.error(err);
    else
      console.log('I have power');
  }
);
```

Note that if node-oracledb is using the Oracle client libraries
located in the Oracle Database installation, i.e. is on the same
machine as the database and is not using Oracle Instant Client, then
operating system privileges may be used for authentication.  In this
case the password value is ignored.  For example on Linux, membership
of the operating system [`dba`][96] group allows `SYSDBA` connections.

Administrative privileges can allow access to a database instance even
when the database is not open.  Control of these privileges is totally
outside of the database itself.  Care must be taken with
authentication to ensure security.  See the [Database Administrators
Guide][90] for information.

### <a name="securenetwork"></a> 8.7 Securely Encrypting Network Traffic to Oracle Database

Data transferred between Oracle Database and the Oracle client
libraries used by node-oracledb can be [encrypted][30] so that
unauthorized parties are not able to view plain text data as it passes
over the network.  The easiest configuration is Oracle's native
network encryption.  The standard SSL protocol can also be used if you
have a PKI, but setup is necessarily more involved.

With native network encryption, the client and database server
negotiate a key using Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  There is
protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Native network encryption can be configured by editing Oracle Net's
optional `sqlnet.ora` configuration files, on either the database server
and/or on each node-oracledb 'client'.  Parameters control whether
data integrity checking and encryption is required or just allowed,
and which algorithms the client and server should consider for use.

As an example, to ensure all connections to the database are checked
for integrity and are also encrypted, create or edit the Oracle
Database `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora` file.  Set the
checksum negotiation to always validate a checksum and set the
checksum type to your desired value.  The network encryption settings
can similarly be set.  For example, to use the SHA512 checksum and
AES256 encryption use:

```
SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_SERVER = required
SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_SERVER = (SHA512)
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER = required
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER = (AES256)
```

If you definitely know that the database server enforces integrity and
encryption, then you do not need to configure Node.js separately.
However you can also, or alternatively, do so depending on your
business needs.  Create a `sqlnet.ora` and locate it with other
[Optional Client Configuration Files](#tnsadmin):

```
SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_CLIENT = required
SQLNET.CRYPTO_CHECKSUM_TYPES_CLIENT = (SHA512)
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = required
SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT = (AES256)
```

The client and server sides can negotiate the protocols used if the
settings indicate more than one value is accepted.

Note these are example settings only.  You must review your security
requirements and read the documentation for your Oracle version.  In
particular review the available algorithms for security and
performance.

The `NETWORK_SERVICE_BANNER` column of the database view
[`V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO`][31] can be used to verify the encryption
status of a connection.

For more information about Oracle Data Network Encryption and
Integrity, and for information about configuring SSL network
encryption, refer to the [Oracle Database Security Guide][32].  This
manual also contains information about other important security
features that Oracle Database provides, such Transparent Data
Encryption of data-at-rest in the database.

### <a name="changingpassword"></a> 8.8 Changing Passwords and Connecting with an Expired Password

#### Changing Passwords

Database passwords can be changed with
[`connection.changePassword()`](#changepassword).  For example, the HR
user can change their password from 'welcome' to 'steamboat':

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/orclpdb"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }

    connection.changePassword(
        'hr', 'welcome', 'steamboat',
        function(err) {
        . . .
        });
    . . .
```

Only DBAs, or users with the ALTER USER privilege, can change the
password of another user.  In this case, the old password value is
ignored and can be an empty string:

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "system",   // a privileged user
    password      : "secret",
    connectString : "localhost/orclpdb"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }

    connection.changePassword(
        'hr', '', 'steamboat',  // change HR's password to 'steamboat'
        function(err) {
        . . .
        });
    . . .
```

#### Connecting with an Expired Password

When creating a standalone, non-pooled connection the user's password
can be changed at time of connection.  This is most useful when the
user's password has expired, because it allows a user to connect
without requiring a DBA to reset their password.

Both the current and new passwords must be given when connecting.  For
example, if HR's password is 'welcome', it can be changed to
'steamboat' like:

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    newPassword   : "steamboat",
    connectString : "localhost/orclpdb"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
  . . .
```

### <a name="connectionha"></a> 8.9 Connections and High Availability

For applications that need to be highly available, you may want to
configure your OS network settings and Oracle Net (which handles
communication between node-oracledb and the database).

For Oracle Net configuration, create a `sqlnet.ora` file.  See
[Optional Client Configuration Files](#tnsadmin) for where to place
this.  In this file you can configure settings like
[`SQLNET.OUTBOUND_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`][33], [`SQLNET.RECV_TIMEOUT`][34]
and [`SQLNET.SEND_TIMEOUT`][35].  You may also want to use a
[`tnsnames.ora`](#tnsnames) file to configure the database service
setting [`ENABLE=BROKEN`][36].

Other [Oracle Network Services][37] options may also be useful for
high availability and performance tuning.

#### <a name="connectionfan"></a> 8.9.1 Fast Application Notification (FAN)

Users of [Oracle Database FAN][64] should set
[`oracledb.events`](#propdbevents) to *true*.  This can also be
enabled via [External Configuration](#oraaccess).

FAN support gives fast connection failover, an Oracle Database high
availability feature.  This allows applications to be notified when a
database machine becomes unavailable.  Without FAN, node-oracledb can
hang until a TCP timeout occurs and an error is returned, which might
be several minutes.  Enabling FAN in node-oracledb can allow
applications to detect errors, re-connect to an available database
instance, and replay application logic without the application user
being aware of an outage.  It is up to the application to handle
errors and take desired action.

FAN benefits users of Oracle Database's clustering technology ([Oracle
RAC][93]) because connections to surviving database instances can be
immediately made.  Users of Oracle's Data Guard with a broker will see
the FAN events generated when the standby database goes online.
Standalone databases will send FAN events when the database restarts.

For active connections, when a machine or database instance becomes
unavailable, a connection failure error will be returned by the
node-oracledb method currently being called.  On a subsequent
re-connect, a connection to a surviving database instance will be
established.  Node-oracledb also transparently cleans up any idle
connections affected by a database machine or instance failure so
future connect calls will establish a fresh connection without the
application being aware of any service disruption.

For a more information on FAN see the [whitepaper on Fast Application
Notification][97].


#### <a name="connectionrlb"></a> 8.9.2 Runtime Load Balancing (RLB)

[Oracle Database RAC][93] users with [Oracle Database (RLB)][65]
advisory events configured should use node-oracledb [Connection
Pooling](#connpooling) and set [`oracledb.events`](#propdbevents) to
*true*.  The events mode can also be enabled via [External
Configuration](#oraaccess).

RLB allows optimal use of database resources by balancing database
requests across RAC instances.

For a more information on RLB, see the [whitepaper on Fast Application
Notification][97].

### <a name="tnsadmin"></a> 8.10 Optional Client Configuration Files

Optional Oracle Client configuration files are read when node-oracledb
is loaded.  These files affect connections and applications.  Common
files include `tnsnames.ora`, `sqlnet.ora`, `ldap.ora`, and
[`oraaccess.xml`](#oraaccess).

Default locations for these files include:

- `/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2/network/admin` if Instant Client is in `/opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2`.
- `/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/network/admin` if Oracle 12.2 Instant Client RPMs are used on Linux.
- `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin` if node-oracledb is using libraries from the database installation.

Alternatively, Oracle Client configuration files can be put in
another, accessible directory.  Then set the environment variable
[`TNS_ADMIN`][8] to that directory name.  For example, if the file
`/etc/my-oracle-config/tnsnames.ora` is being used, set `TNS_ADMIN` to
`/etc/my-oracle-config`.

## <a name="sqlexecution"></a> 9. SQL Execution

A single SQL or PL/SQL statement may be executed using the
*Connection* [`execute()`](#execute) method.  The callback style shown
below, or [promises](#promiseoverview), or
[Async/Await](#asyncawaitoverview) may be used.

Results may be returned in a single array, or fetched in batches with
a [ResultSet](#resultsetclass).  Queries may optionally be streamed
using the [`connection.queryStream()`](#querystream) method.

Node-oracledb's [`execute()`](#execute)
and [`queryStream()`](#querystream) methods
use [Statement Caching](#stmtcache) to make re-execution of statements
efficient.  This removes the need for a separate 'prepare' method to
parse statements.

For queries that return a large number of rows, the network traffic
for fetching data from Oracle Database can be optimized by increasing
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize).  For queries that
are known to return a small set of rows, reduce
[`fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) to avoid unnecessary memory
allocation.  The `execute()` option
[`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize) can be used to override
the global property for individual queries.

Connections can handle one database operation at a time.  Other
database operations will block.  Structure your code to avoid starting
parallel operations on a connection.  For example, instead of using
`async.parallel` or `async.each()` which calls each of its items in
parallel, use `async.series` or `async.eachSeries()`.  Also
see [Connections and Number of Threads](#numberofthreads).

After all database calls on the connection complete, the application
should use the [`connection.close()`](#connectionclose) call to
release the connection.

### <a name="select"></a> 9.1 SELECT Statements

#### <a name="fetchingrows"></a> 9.1.1 Fetching Rows with Direct Fetches

By default, queries are handled as 'direct fetches', meaning all
results are returned in the callback [`result.rows`](#execrows)
property:

```javascript
    connection.execute(
      `SELECT department_id, department_name
       FROM departments
       WHERE department_id = :did`,
      [180],
      { maxRows: 10 },  // a maximum of 10 rows will be returned
      function(err, result) {
        if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
        console.log(result.rows);  // print all returned rows
      });
```

Any rows beyond the `maxRows` limit are not returned.  If `maxRows` is
0, then the number of rows is only limited by Node.js memory.

To improve database efficiency, SQL queries should use a row limiting
clause like [OFFSET / FETCH](#pagingdata) or equivalent. The `maxRows`
property can be used to stop badly coded queries from returning
unexpectedly large numbers of rows.

Internally, rows are fetched from Oracle Database in batches.  The
internal batch size is based on the lesser of `fetchArraySize` and
`maxRows`.  Each batch is concatenated into the array returned to the
application.

For queries expected to return a small number of rows, reduce
`maxRows` or [`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize) to reduce
internal memory overhead by node-oracledb.

For direct fetches, JavaScript memory can become a limitation in two
cases:

- the absolute amount of data returned is simply too large for
  JavaScript to hold in a single array.

- the JavaScript heap can be exceeded, or become fragmented, due to
  concatenation of the buffers of records fetched from the database.
  To minimize this, use a `fetchArraySize` value determined by tuning.

In both cases, use a [ResultSet](#resultsethandling) or [Query
Stream](#streamingresults) instead of a direct fetch.

#### <a name="resultsethandling"></a> 9.1.2 Working with Result Sets

When the number of query rows is relatively big, or can't be
predicted, it is recommended to use a [ResultSet](#resultsetclass)
with callbacks, as described in this section, or via query streaming,
as described [later](#streamingresults).  This prevents query results
being unexpectedly truncated by the [`maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows) limit,
or exceeding Node.js memory constraints.  Otherwise, for queries that
return a known small number of rows, non-ResultSet queries may have
less overhead.

A ResultSet is created when the `execute()` option property
[`resultSet`](#executeoptions) is *true*.  ResultSet rows can be
fetched using [`getRow()`](#getrow) or [`getRows()`](#getrows) on the
`execute()` callback function's `result.resultSet` property.

For ResultSets, the [`maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows) limit is ignored.  All
rows can be fetched.

When all rows have been fetched, or the application does not want to
continue getting more rows, then the ResultSet should be freed using
[`close()`](#close).  The ResultSet should also be explicitly closed
in the cases where no rows will be fetched from it.

REF CURSORS returned from a PL/SQL block via an `oracledb.CURSOR` OUT
binds are also available as a ResultSet. See
[REF CURSOR Bind Parameters](#refcursors).

The format of each row will be an array or object, depending on the
value of [outFormat](#propdboutformat).

See [resultset1.js][38], [resultset2.js][39] and [refcursor.js][40]
for full examples.

To fetch one row at a time use getRow() :

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "SELECT employee_id, last_name FROM employees ORDER BY employee_id",
  [], // no bind variables
  { resultSet: true }, // return a Result Set.  Default is false
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { . . . }
    fetchOneRowFromRS(connection, result.resultSet);
  });
});

function fetchOneRowFromRS(connection, resultSet) {
  resultSet.getRow( // get one row
    function (err, row) {
      if (err) {
         . . .           // close the Result Set and release the connection
      } else if (!row) { // no rows, or no more rows
        . . .            // close the Result Set and release the connection
      } else {
        console.log(row);
        fetchOneRowFromRS(connection, resultSet);  // get next row
      }
    });
}
```

To fetch multiple rows at a time, use `getRows()`:


```javascript
var numRows = 10;  // number of rows to return from each call to getRows()

connection.execute(
  "SELECT employee_id, last_name FROM employees ORDER BY employee_id",
  [], // no bind variables
  { resultSet: true }, // return a ResultSet.  Default is false
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { . . . }
    fetchRowsFromRS(connection, result.resultSet, numRows);
  });
});

function fetchRowsFromRS(connection, resultSet, numRows) {
  resultSet.getRows( // get numRows rows
    numRows,
    function (err, rows) {
      if (err) {
         . . .                        // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      } else if (rows.length > 0) {   // got some rows
        console.log(rows);            // process rows
        if (rows.length === numRows)  // might be more rows
          fetchRowsFromRS(connection, resultSet, numRows);
        else                          // got fewer rows than requested so must be at end
          . . .                       // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      } else {                        // else no rows
          . . .                       // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      }
    });
}
```

#### <a name="streamingresults"></a> 9.1.3 Query Streaming

Streaming of query results allows data to be piped to other streams, for
example when dealing with HTTP responses.

Use [`connection.queryStream()`](#querystream) to create a stream from
a top level query and listen for events.  You can also call
[`connection.execute()`](#execute) and use
[`toQueryStream()`](#toquerystream) to return a stream from the
returned [ResultSet](#resultsetclass) or OUT bind REF CURSOR
ResultSet.

With streaming, each row is returned as a `data` event.  Query
metadata is available via a `metadata` event.  The `end` event
indicates the end of the query results.

Query results should be fetched to completion to avoid resource leaks,
or (from Node.js 8 onwards) the Stream [`destroy()`][92] method can be
used to terminate a stream early.  For older Node.js versions use a
[ResultSet with callbacks](#resultsethandling) if you need to stop a
query before retrieving all data.  Note the previous, experimental
`_close()` method no longer emits a 'close' event.

The connection must remain open until the stream is completely read
and any returned [Lob](#lobclass) objects have been processed.

The query stream implementation is a wrapper over the [ResultSet
Class](#resultsetclass).  In particular, successive calls to
[getRow()](#getrow) are made internally.  Each row will generate a
`data` event.  For tuning, adjust the value of
[`oracledb.fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize) or the `execute()`
option [`fetchArraySize`](#propexecfetcharraysize).

An example of streaming query results is:

```javascript
var stream = connection.queryStream('SELECT employees_name FROM employees');

stream.on('error', function (error) {
  // handle any error...
});

stream.on('data', function (data) {
  // handle data row...
});

stream.on('end', function () {
  // release connection...
});

stream.on('metadata', function (metadata) {
  // access metadata of query
});

// listen to any other standard stream events...
```

See [selectstream.js][41] for a runnable example using
`connection.queryStream()`.

The [REF CURSOR Bind Parameters](#refcursors) section shows using
`toQueryStream()` to return a stream for a REF CURSOR.

#### <a name="queryoutputformats"></a> 9.1.4 Query Output Formats

Query rows may be returned as an array of column values, or as
JavaScript objects, depending on the values of
[outFormat](#propdboutformat).

The default format for each row is an array of column values.
For example:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
. . .

connection.execute(
  `SELECT department_id, department_name
   FROM departments
   WHERE manager_id < :id`,
  [110],  // bind value for :id
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.rows);
  });
```

If run with Oracle's sample HR schema, the output is:

```
[ [ 60, 'IT' ], [ 90, 'Executive' ], [ 100, 'Finance' ] ]
```

Using this format is recommended for efficiency.

Alternatively, rows may be fetched as JavaScript objects. To do so,
specify the `outFormat` option to be `oracledb.OBJECT`:

```javascript
oracledb.outFormat = oracledb.OBJECT;
```

The value can also be set as an `execute()` option:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  `SELECT department_id, department_name
   FROM departments
   WHERE manager_id < :id`,
  [110],  // bind value for :id
  { outFormat: oracledb.OBJECT },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.rows);
  });
```

The output is:

```
[ { DEPARTMENT_ID: 60, DEPARTMENT_NAME: 'IT' },
  { DEPARTMENT_ID: 90, DEPARTMENT_NAME: 'Executive' },
  { DEPARTMENT_ID: 100, DEPARTMENT_NAME: 'Finance' } ]
```

In the preceding example, each row is a JavaScript object that
specifies column names and their respective values.  Note the property
names follow Oracle's standard name-casing rules.  They will commonly
be uppercase, since most applications create tables using unquoted,
case-insensitive names.

#### <a name="querymeta"></a> 9.1.5 Query Column Metadata

The column names of a query are returned in the `execute()` callback's
[`result.metaData`](#execmetadata) attribute:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  `SELECT department_id, department_name
   FROM departments
   WHERE manager_id < :id`,
  [110],  // bind value for :id
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.metaData);  // show the metadata
  });
```

When using a [ResultSet](#resultsetclass), metadata is also
available in [`result.resultSet.metaData`](#rsmetadata).  For queries
using [`queryStream()`](#querystream), metadata is available via the
`metadata` event.

The metadata is an array of objects, one per column.  By default each
object has a `name` attribute:

```
[ { name: 'DEPARTMENT_ID' }, { name: 'DEPARTMENT_NAME' } ]
```

The names are in uppercase.  This is the default casing behavior for
Oracle client programs when a database table is created with unquoted,
case-insensitive column names.

##### Extended Metadata

More metadata is included when the
[`oracledb.extendedMetaData`](#propdbextendedmetadata) or `connection.execute()` option
[`extendedMetaData`](#propexecextendedmetadata) is *true*.  For
example:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "SELECT department_id, department_name " +
    "FROM departments " +
    "WHERE manager_id < :id",
  [110],  // bind value for :id
  { extendedMetaData: true },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.metaData);  // show the extended metadata
  });
```

The output is:

```
[ { name: 'DEPARTMENT_ID',
    fetchType: 2002,
    dbType: 2,
    precision: 4,
    scale: 0,
    nullable: false },
  { name: 'DEPARTMENT_NAME',
    fetchType: 2001,
    dbType: 1,
    byteSize: 30,
    nullable: false } ]
```

Description of the properties is given in the
[`result.metaData`](#execmetadata) description.

#### <a name="typemap"></a> 9.1.6 Query Result Type Mapping

Supported Oracle number, date, character, ROWID, UROWID, LONG and LONG
RAW column types are selected as Numbers, Dates, Strings, or Buffers.
BLOBs and CLOBs are selected into [Lobs](#lobclass).

The default mapping for some types can be changed
using [`fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer),
or [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring).
The [`fetchInfo`](#propexecfetchinfo) property can also be used to
change the default mapping, or override a global mapping, for
individual columns.

Data types in `SELECT` statements that are unsupported give an error
*NJS-010: unsupported data type in select list*.  These include
INTERVAL, BFILE and XMLType types.

Details are in the following sections.

##### <a name="stringhandling"></a> 9.1.6.1 Fetching CHAR, VARCHAR2, NCHAR and NVARCHAR

Columns of database type CHAR, VARCHAR2, NCHAR and NVARCHAR are
returned from queries as JavaScript strings.

Note that binding NCHAR and NVARCHAR for [DML][14] is not supported
and may cause unexpected character set translation, see [Bind Data
Type Notes](#binddatatypenotes).

##### <a name="numberhandling"></a> 9.1.6.2 Fetching Numbers

By default all numeric columns are mapped to JavaScript numbers.
Node.js uses double floating point numbers as its native number type.

When numbers are fetched from the database, conversion to JavaScript's
less precise binary number format can result in "unexpected"
representations.  For example:

```javascript
conn.execute(
"select 38.73 from dual",
function (err, result) {
  if (err)
    . . .
  else
    console.log(result.rows[0]); // gives 38.730000000000004
});
```

Similar issues can occur with binary floating-point arithmetic
purely in Node.js, for example:

```javascript
console.log(0.2 + 0.7); // gives 0.8999999999999999
```

Node.js can also only represent numbers up to 2 ^ 53
which is 9007199254740992.  Numbers larger than this will be truncated.

The primary recommendation for number handling is to use Oracle SQL or
PL/SQL for mathematical operations, particularly for currency
calculations.

To reliably work with numbers in Node.js, use `fetchAsString` or
`fetchInfo` (see [below](#fetchasstringhandling)) to fetch numbers in
string format, and then use one of the available third-party
JavaScript number libraries that handles large values and more
precision.

##### <a name="datehandling"></a> 9.1.6.3 Fetching Dates and Timestamps

By default, date and timestamp columns are mapped to JavaScript Date
objects.  Internally, DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME
ZONE, and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE columns are fetched as
TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE using the session time zone.
Oracle INTERVAL types are not supported.

Note that JavaScript Date has millisecond precision therefore
timestamps will lose any sub-millisecond fractional part when fetched.

To make applications more portable, it is recommended to always set
the session time zone to a pre-determined value, such as UTC.  This
can be done by setting the environment variable [`ORA_SDTZ`][42]
before starting Node.js, for example:

```
$ export ORA_SDTZ='UTC'
$ node myapp.js
```

The session time zone can also be changed at runtime for each connection by
executing:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE='UTC'",
  function(err) { ... }
);
```

To do this without requiring the overhead of a round-trip to execute
the `ALTER` statement, you could use a PL/SQL trigger:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER my_logon_trigger
  AFTER LOGON
  ON hr.SCHEMA
BEGIN
  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE=''UTC''';
END;
```

See [Working with Dates Using the Node.js Driver][43] for more
discussion of date handling.

##### <a name="fetchasstringhandling"></a> 9.1.6.4 Fetching Numbers and Dates as String

The global [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring) property can be
used to force all number or date columns
(and [CLOB columns](#queryinglobs)) queried by an application to be
fetched as strings instead of in native format.  Allowing data to be
fetched as strings helps avoid situations where using JavaScript types
can lead to numeric precision loss, or where date conversion is
unwanted.

For example, to force all dates and numbers used by queries in an
application to be fetched as strings:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.fetchAsString = [ oracledb.DATE, oracledb.NUMBER ];
```

For dates and numbers, the maximum length of a string created can be
200 bytes.

Individual queries can use the [`execute()`](#execute) option
[`fetchInfo`](#propexecfetchinfo) to map individual number or date columns
to strings without affecting other columns or other queries.  Any
global `fetchAsString` setting can be overridden to allow specific
columns to have data returned in native format:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.fetchAsString = [ oracledb.NUMBER ];  // any number queried will be returned as a string

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    connection.execute(
      "SELECT last_name, hire_date, salary, commission_pct FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :id",
      [178],
      {
        fetchInfo :
        {
          "HIRE_DATE":      { type : oracledb.STRING },  // return the date as a string
          "COMMISSION_PCT": { type : oracledb.DEFAULT }  // override oracledb.fetchAsString and fetch as native type
        }
      },
      function(err, result) {
        if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
        console.log(result.rows);
      });
  });
```

The output is:

```
[ [ 'Grant', '24-MAY-07', '7000', 0.15 ] ]
```

The date and salary columns are returned as strings, but the
commission is a number.  The date is mapped using the current session
date format, which was `DD-MON-YY` in this example.  The default date
format can be set, for example, with the environment variable
`NLS_DATE_FORMAT`.  Note this variable will only be read if `NLS_LANG`
is also set.

Without the mapping capabilities provided by `fetchAsString` and
`fetchInfo` the hire date would have been a JavaScript date in the
local time zone, and both numeric columns would have been
represented as numbers:

```
[ [ 'Grant', Thu May 24 2007 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (AEST), 7000, 0.15 ] ]
```

To map columns returned from REF CURSORS, use `fetchAsString`.  The
`fetchInfo` settings do not apply.

When using `fetchAsString` or `fetchInfo` for numbers, you may need to
explicitly use `NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS` to override your NLS settings
and force the decimal separator to be a period.  This can be done for
each connection by executing the statement:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "ALTER SESSION SET NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS = '.,'",
  function(err) { ... }
);
```

Alternatively you can set the equivalent environment variable prior
to starting Node.js:

```
$ export NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS='.,'
```

Note this environment variable is not used unless the `NLS_LANG`
environment variable is also set.

##### <a name="fetchlob"></a> 9.1.6.5 Fetching BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB

By default BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB columns are fetched into [Lob](#lobclass)
instances.  For small LOBs it can be more convenient to fetch them
directly into Buffers or Strings by using the
global [`fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer)
or [`fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring) settings, or the
per-column [`fetchInfo`](#propexecfetchinfo) setting.  See the
section [Working with CLOB and BLOB Data](#lobhandling).

Note that binding NCLOB for [DML][14] is not supported and may cause
unexpected character set translation, see [Bind Data Type
Notes](#binddatatypenotes).

##### <a name="fetchlong"></a> 9.1.6.6 Fetching LONG and LONG RAW

LONG columns in queries will be fetched as Strings.  LONG RAW columns
will be fetched as Buffers.

Unlike for LOBs, there is no support for streaming LONG types.  Oracle
Database allows values 2 GB in length, but Node.js and V8 memory
limitations typically only allow memory chunks in the order of tens of
megabytes.  This means complete data may not be able to fetched from
the database.  The SQL function [`TO_LOB`][44] can be used to migrate
data to LOB columns which can be streamed to node-oracledb, however
`TO_LOB` cannot be used directly in a `SELECT`.

##### <a name="fetchrowid"></a> 9.1.6.7 Fetching ROWID and UROWID

Queries will return ROWID and UROWID columns as Strings.

##### <a name="fetchxml"></a> 9.1.6.8 Fetching XMLType

`XMLType` columns cannot be queried directly.  Instead handle them as
CLOBs, see [Working with XMLType](#xmltype).

##### <a name="fetchraw"></a> 9.1.6.9 Fetching RAW

Queries will return RAW columns as Node.js Buffers.

##### <a name="customtypehandling"></a> 9.1.6.10 Mapping Custom Types

Data types such as an Oracle Locator `SDO_GEOMETRY`, or your own custom
types, cannot be fetched directly in node-oracledb.  Instead, utilize
techniques such as using an intermediary PL/SQL procedure to map the
type components to scalar values, or use a pipelined table.

For example, consider a `CUSTOMERS` table having a `CUST_GEO_LOCATION`
column of type `SDO_GEOMETRY`, as created in this [example
schema][45]:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id NUMBER,
  last_name VARCHAR2(30),
  cust_geo_location SDO_GEOMETRY);

INSERT INTO customers VALUES
  (1001, 'Nichols', SDO_GEOMETRY(2001, 8307, SDO_POINT_TYPE (-71.48923,42.72347,NULL), NULL, NULL));

COMMIT;
```

Instead of attempting to get `CUST_GEO_LOCATION` by directly calling a
PL/SQL procedure that returns an `SDO_GEOMETRY` parameter, you could
instead get the scalar coordinates by using an intermediary PL/SQL
block that decomposes the geometry:

```javascript
    . . .
    var sql =
      "BEGIN " +
      "  SELECT t.x, t.y" +
      "  INTO :x, :y" +
      "  FROM customers, TABLE(sdo_util.getvertices(customers.cust_geo_location)) t" +
      "  WHERE customer_id = :id;" +
      "END; ";
    var bindvars = {
      id: 1001,
      x: { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir : oracledb.BIND_OUT },
      y: { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir : oracledb.BIND_OUT }
    }
    connection.execute(
      sql,
      bindvars,
      function (err, result) {
        if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
        console.log(result.outBinds);
      });
```

The output is:

```
{ x: -71.48922999999999, y: 42.72347 }
```

Note the JavaScript precision difference.  In this particular example,
you may want to bind using `type: oracledb.STRING`.  Output would be:

```
{ x: '-71.48923', y: '42.72347' }
```

#### <a name="pagingdata"></a> 9.1.7 Limiting Rows and Creating Paged Datasets

Query data is commonly broken into small sets for two reasons:

- 'Web pagination' that allows moving from one set of rows to a next,
  or previous, set.

- Fetching of consectitive small sets of data for processing.  This
  happens because the number of records is too large for Node.js to
  handle at the same time.

The latter can be handled by [ResultSets](#resultsethandling) or
[`queryStream()`](#querystream) with one execution of the SQL query as
discsussed in those links.

How to do 'web pagination' is discussed in this section.  For each
'page' of results, a SQL query is executed to get the appropriate set
of rows from a table.  Since the query will be executed more than
once, make sure to use bind variables for row numbers and row limits.

Oracle Database 12c SQL has an [OFFSET / FETCH][5] clause, which is
similar to the LIMIT keyword of MySQL.

```javascript
var myoffset = 0;       // don't skip any rows (start at row 1)
var mymaxnumrows = 20;  // get 20 rows

connection.execute(
  `SELECT last_name
   FROM employees
   ORDER BY last_name
   OFFSET :offset ROWS FETCH NEXT :maxnumrows ROWS ONLY`,
  {offset: myoffset, maxnumrows: mymaxnumrows},
. . .
```

See [rowlimit.js][84].

You can use a basic [`execute()`](#execute) or a
[ResultSet](#resultsetclass), or [`queryStream()`](#querystream) with
your query.  For basic `execute()` fetches, make sure that
`oracledb.maxRows` is greater than the value bound to `:maxnumrows`,
or set to 0 (meaning unlimited).

In applications where the SQL query is not known in advance, this
method sometimes involves appending the `OFFSET` clause to the 'real'
user query. Be very careful to avoid SQL injection security issues.

As an anti-example, another way to limit the number of rows returned
involves setting [`maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows).  However it is more
efficient to let Oracle Database do the row selection in the SQL query
and only return the exact number of rows required to node-oracledb.

For Oracle Database 11g and earlier there are several alternative ways
to limit the number of rows returned.  Refer to [Oracle Magazine][85]
for details.

The old, canonical paging query is:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT a.*, ROWNUM AS rnum
      FROM (YOUR_QUERY_GOES_HERE -- including the order by) a
      WHERE ROWNUM <= MAX_ROW)
WHERE rnum >= MIN_ROW
```

Here, `MIN_ROW` is the row number of first row and `MAX_ROW` is the
row number of the last row to return.  For example:

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT a.*, ROWNUM AS rnum
      FROM (SELECT last_name FROM employees ORDER BY last_name) a
      WHERE ROWNUM <= 20)
WHERE rnum >= 1
```

This always has an 'extra' column, here called RNUM.

An alternative and preferred query syntax for Oracle Database 11g uses
the analytic `ROW_NUMBER()` function. For example to get the 1st to
20th names the query is:

```SQL
SELECT last_name FROM
(SELECT last_name,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY last_name) AS myr
        FROM employees)
WHERE myr BETWEEN 1 and 20
```

#### <a name="autoincrement"></a> 9.1.8 Auto-Increment Columns

In Oracle Database 12c you can create tables with auto-incremented
values.  This is useful to generate unique primary keys for your data
when ROWID or UROWID are not preferred.

In SQL*Plus execute:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE mytable
  (myid NUMBER(11) GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1),
   mydata VARCHAR2(20)
  )
```

Refer to the [CREATE TABLE identity column documentation][86].

If you already have a sequence `myseq` you can use values from it to
auto-increment a column value like this:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE mytable
  (myid NUMBER DEFAULT myseq.NEXTVAL,
   mydata VARCHAR2(20)
  )
```

This also requires Oracle Database 12c.

Prior to Oracle Database 12c, auto-increment columns in Oracle
Database can be created using a sequence generator and a trigger.

Sequence generators are defined in the database and return Oracle
numbers.  Sequence numbers are generated independently of tables.
Therefore, the same sequence generator can be used for more than one
table or anywhere that you want to use a unique number.  You can get a
new value from a sequence generator using the NEXTVAL operator in a
SQL statement.  This gives the next available number and increments
the generator.  The similar CURRVAL operator returns the current value
of a sequence without incrementing the generator.

A trigger is a PL/SQL procedure that is automatically invoked at a
predetermined point.  In this example a trigger is invoked whenever an
insert is made to a table.

In SQL*Plus run:

```SQL
CREATE SEQUENCE myseq;
CREATE TABLE mytable (myid NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, mydata VARCHAR2(20));
CREATE TRIGGER mytrigger BEFORE INSERT ON mytable FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  :new.myid := myseq.NEXTVAL;
END;
/
```

Prior to Oracle Database 11g replace the trigger assignment with a
SELECT like:

```SQL
SELECT myseq.NEXTVAL INTO :new.myid FROM dual;
```

##### Getting the Last Insert ID

To get the automatically inserted identifier in node-oracledb, use a
[DML RETURNING](#dmlreturn) clause:

```javascript
. . .
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO mytable (mydata) VALUES ('Hello') RETURN myid INTO :id",
  {id : {type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT } },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds.id);  // print the ID of the inserted row
  });
```

### <a name="cursors1000"></a> 9.2 Cursor Management

Developers starting out with Node have to get to grips with the
'different' programming style of JavaScript that seems to cause
methods to be called when least expected!  While you are still in the
initial hacking-around-with-node-oracledb phase you may sometimes
encounter the error *ORA-01000: maximum open cursors exceeded*.  A
cursor is a "handle for the session-specific private SQL area that
holds a parsed SQL statement and other processing information".

Here are things to do when you see an *ORA-1000*:

- Avoid having too many incompletely processed statements open at one time:

    - Make sure your application is handling connections and statements
      in the order you expect.

    - [Close ResultSets](#close) before releasing the connection.

    - If cursors are opened with `DBMS_SQL.OPEN_CURSOR()` in a PL/SQL
      block, close them before the block returns - except for REF
      CURSORs being passed back to node-oracledb.

- Choose the appropriate Statement Cache size.  Node-oracledb has a
  statement cache per connection.  When node-oracledb internally
  releases a statement it will be put into the statement cache of that
  connection, and its cursor will remain open. This makes statement
  re-execution very efficient.

  The cache size is settable with the
  [`oracle.stmtCacheSize`](#propdbstmtcachesize) attribute.
  The size you choose will depend on your knowledge of the
  locality of the statements, and of the resources available to the
  application.  Are statements re-executed?  Will they still be in the
  cache when they get executed?  How many statements do you want to be
  cached?  In rare cases when statements are not re-executed, or are
  likely not to be in the cache, you might even want to disable the
  cache to eliminate its management overheads.

  Incorrectly sizing the statement cache will reduce application
  efficiency.

  To help set the cache size, you can turn on auto-tuning with Oracle
  12.1 using an [*oraaccess.xml*](#oraaccess) file.

  For more information, see the [Statement Caching](#stmtcache) documentation.

- Use bind variables otherwise each variant of the statement will have
  its own statement cache entry and cursor.  With appropriate binding
  only one entry and cursor will be needed.

- Set the database's [*open_cursors*][47] parameter appropriately.
  This parameter specifies the maximum number of cursors that each
  "session" (i.e each node-oracle connection) can use.  When a
  connection exceeds the value, the *ORA-1000* error is thrown.

  Along with a cursor per entry in the connection's statement cache,
  any new statements that a connection is currently executing, or
  ResultSets that haven't been released (in neither situation are
  these yet cached), will also consume a cursor.  Make sure that
  *open_cursors* is large enough to accommodate the maximum open
  cursors any connection may have.  The upper bound required is
  *stmtCacheSize* + the maximum number of executing statements in a
  connection.

  Remember this is all per connection. Also cache management happens
  when statements are internally released.  The majority of your
  connections may use less than *open_cursors* cursors, but if one
  connection is at the limit and it then tries to execute a new
  statement, that connection will get *ORA-1000: maximum open cursors
  exceeded*.

## <a name="plsqlexecution"></a> 10. PL/SQL Execution

PL/SQL stored procedures, functions and anonymous blocks can be called
from node-oracledb using [`execute()`](#execute).

Note the error property of the callback is not set when PL/SQL
"success with info" warnings such as compilation warnings occur.

### <a name="plsqlproc"></a> 10.1 PL/SQL Stored Procedures

The PL/SQL procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE myproc (id IN NUMBER, name OUT VARCHAR2) AS
BEGIN
  SELECT last_name INTO name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = id;
END;
```

can be called:

```javascript
. . .
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN myproc(:id, :name); END;",
  {  // bind variables
    id:   159,
    name: { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 40 },
  },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  });
```

The output is:

```
{ name: 'Smith' }
```

Binding is required for IN OUT and OUT parameters.  It is strongly
recommended for IN parameters.  See
[Bind Parameters for Prepared Statements](#bind).

### <a name="plsqlfunc"></a> 10.2 PL/SQL Stored Functions

The PL/SQL function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION myfunc RETURN VARCHAR2 AS
BEGIN
  RETURN 'Hello';
END;
```

can be called by using an OUT bind variable for the function return value:

```javascript
. . .
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN :ret := myfunc(); END;",
  { ret: { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 40 } },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  });
```

The output is:

```
{ ret: 'Hello' }
```

See [Bind Parameters for Prepared Statements](#bind) for information on binding.

### <a name="plsqlanon"></a> 10.3 PL/SQL Anonymous PL/SQL Blocks

Anonymous PL/SQL blocks can be called from node-oracledb like:

```javascript
. . .
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN SELECT last_name INTO :name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :id; END;",
  {  // bind variables
    id:   134,
    name: { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 40 },
  },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  });
```

The output is:

```
{ name: 'Rogers' }
```

See [Bind Parameters for Prepared Statements](#bind) for information on binding.

### <a name="dbmsoutput"></a> 10.4 Using DBMS_OUTPUT

The [DBMS_OUTPUT][48] package is the standard way to "print" output
from PL/SQL.  The way DBMS_OUTPUT works is like a buffer.  Your
Node.js application code must first turn on DBMS_OUTPUT buffering for
the current connection by calling the PL/SQL procedure
`DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE(NULL)`.  Then any PL/SQL executed by the
connection can put text into the buffer using
`DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE()`.  Finally `DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE()` is used to
fetch from that buffer.  Note, any PL/SQL code that uses DBMS_OUTPUT
runs to completion before any output is available to the user.  Also,
other database connections cannot access your buffer.

A basic way to fetch DBMS_OUTPUT with node-oracledb is to bind an
output string when calling the PL/SQL `DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE()`
procedure, print the string, and then repeat until there is no more
data.  The following snippet is based on the example
[dbmsoutputgetline.js][49]:

```javascript
function fetchDbmsOutputLine(connection, cb) {
  connection.execute(
    "BEGIN DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE(:ln, :st); END;",
    { ln: { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 32767 },
      st: { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.NUMBER } },
    function(err, result) {
      if (err) {
        return cb(err, connection);
      } else if (result.outBinds.st == 1) { // no more output
        return cb(null, connection);
      } else {
        console.log(result.outBinds.ln);
        return fetchDbmsOutputLine(connection, cb);
      }
    });
  }
```

Another way is to wrap the `DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE()` call into a
pipelined function and fetch the output using a SQL query.  See
[dbmsoutputpipe.js][50] for the full example.

The pipelined function could be created like:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE dorow AS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(32767);
/

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mydofetch RETURN dorow PIPELINED IS
  line VARCHAR2(32767);
  status INTEGER;
  BEGIN LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE(line, status);
    EXIT WHEN status = 1;
    PIPE ROW (line);
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

To get DBMS_OUTPUT that has been created, simply execute the query
using the same connection:

```sql
connection.execute(
  "SELECT * FROM TABLE(mydofetch())",
  [],
  { resultSet: true },
  function (err, result) {
  . . .
```

The query rows can be handled using a [ResultSet](#resultsethandling).

Remember to first enable output using `DBMS_OUTPUT.ENABLE(NULL)`.

### <a name="ebr"></a> 10.5 Edition-Based Redefinition

The [Edition-Based Redefinition][98] (EBR) feature of Oracle Database allows
multiple versions of views, synonyms, PL/SQL objects and SQL
Translation profiles to be used concurrently.  Each items version is
associated with an 'edition' which can be nominated at runtime by
applications.  This lets database logic be updated and tested while
production users are still accessing the original version.  Once every
user has begun using the objects in the new edition, the old objects
can be dropped.

To choose the edition, node-oracledb applications can set
[`oracledb.edition`](#propdbedition) globally, or specify a value
when [`creating a pool`](#createpoolpoolattrsedition) or a
[`standalone connection`](#getconnectiondbattrsedition).

The example below shows how a PL/SQL function `DISCOUNT` can be
created with two different implementations.  The initial procedure is
created as normal in the SQL*Plus command line:

```sql
CONNECT nodedemo/welcome

-- The default edition's DISCOUNT procedure

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION discount(price IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER
AS
 newprice NUMBER;
BEGIN
  newprice := price - 4;
  IF (newprice < 1) THEN
    newprice := 1;
  END IF;
  RETURN newprice;
END;
/
```

This initial implementation is in the default 'edition' `ora$base`, which
is pre-created in new and upgraded databases.

The user `nodedemo` can be given permission to create new 'editions':

```sql
CONNECT system/welcome

GRANT CREATE ANY EDITION TO nodedemo;
ALTER USER nodedemo ENABLE EDITIONS FORCE;
```

The next SQL*Plus script creates a new edition `e2`, and changes the
current session to use it.  A new version of `DISCOUNT` is created
under that edition:

```sql
CONNECT nodedemo/welcome

CREATE EDITION e2;
ALTER SESSION SET EDITION = e2;

-- E2 edition's discount

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION discount(price IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER
AS
 newprice NUMBER;
BEGIN
  newprice := 0.75 * price;
  RETURN newprice;
END;
/
```

There are now two implementations of the PL/SQL procedure `DISCOUNT`
with the same prototype.  Applications can choose at runtime which
implementation to use.  Here is a script that calls `DISCOUNT`:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user: 'nodedemo',
    password: 'welcome',
    connectString: 'localhost/orclpdb'
  },
  function (err, connection) {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err.message);
      return;
    }
    connection.execute(
      `SELECT name, price, DISCOUNT(price) AS discountprice
       FROM parts
       ORDER BY id`,
      [],
      { outFormat: oracledb.OBJECT },
      function(err, result) {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err.message);
        } else {
          console.log(result.rows);
        }
      });
  }
);
```

Since the code doesn't explicitly set `oracledb.edition` (or
equivalent), then the first implementation of `DISCOUNT` in the
default edition is used.  The output might be like:

```
[ { NAME: 'lamp', PRICE: 40, DISCOUNTPRICE: 36 },
  { NAME: 'wire', PRICE: 10, DISCOUNTPRICE: 6 },
  { NAME: 'switch', PRICE: 4, DISCOUNTPRICE: 1 } ]
```

If the connection uses edition `e2`, then the second implementation of
`DISCOUNT` will be used:

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user: 'nodedemo',
    password: 'welcome',
    connectString: 'localhost/orclpdb',
    edition: 'e2'
  },
  . . . // same code as before
```

The output might be like:

```
[ { NAME: 'lamp', PRICE: 40, DISCOUNTPRICE: 30 },
  { NAME: 'wire', PRICE: 10, DISCOUNTPRICE: 7.5 },
  { NAME: 'switch', PRICE: 4, DISCOUNTPRICE: 3 } ]

```

See the Database Development Guide chapter [Using Edition-Based
Redefinition][98] for more information about EBR.

## <a name="lobhandling"></a> 11. Working with CLOB and BLOB Data

Oracle Database uses LOB data types to store long objects. The CLOB
type is used for character data and the BLOB type is used for binary
data.  In node-oracledb, LOBs can be represented by instances of
the [Lob](#lobclass) class or as Strings and Buffers.

There are runnable LOB examples in the GitHub [examples][3] directory.

### <a name="basiclobinsert"></a> 11.1 Simple Insertion of LOBs

Node.js String or Buffer types can be passed into PL/SQL blocks or
inserted into the database by binding to LOB columns or PL/SQL
parameters.

If the data is larger than can be handled as a String or Buffer in
Node.js or node-oracledb, it will need to be streamed to
a [Lob](#lobclass), as discussed in [Streams and Lobs](#streamsandlobs).
See [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds) for size considerations regarding
LOB binds.

Given the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mylobs (id NUMBER, c CLOB, b BLOB);
```

an `INSERT` example is:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var str = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
. . .

conn.execute(
  "INSERT INTO mylobs (id, myclobcol) VALUES (:idbv, :cbv)",
  { idbv: 1,
    cbv: str },  // type and direction are optional for IN binds
  function(err, result) {
    if (err)
      console.error(err.message);
    else
      console.log('CLOB inserted from example.txt');
. . .
```

Updating LOBs is similar to insertion:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "UPDATE mylobs SET myclobcol = :cbv WHERE id = :idbv",
  { idbv: 1, cbv: str },
. . .
```

Buffers can similarly be bound for inserting into, or updating, BLOB columns.

When using PL/SQL, a procedure:

```sql
PROCEDURE lobs_in (p_id IN NUMBER, c_in IN CLOB, b_in IN BLOB) . . .
```

can be called like:

```javascript
bigStr = 'My string to insert';
bigBuf = Buffer.from([. . .]);

conn.execute(
  "BEGIN lobs_in(:id, :c, :b); END;",
  { id: 20,
    c: bigStr,    // type and direction are optional for IN binds
    b: bigBuf } },
  function (err) {
    if (err) { return cb(err, conn); }
    console.log("Completed");
    return cb(null, conn);
  }
);
```

### <a name="queryinglobs"></a> 11.2 Simple LOB Queries and PL/SQL OUT Binds

#### Querying LOBs

Smaller LOBs queried from the database can be returned as Strings or Buffers by
using [`oracledb.fetchAsString`](#propdbfetchasstring) or [`oracledb.fetchAsBuffer`](#propdbfetchasbuffer)
(or [`fetchInfo`](#propexecfetchinfo)).  If the data is larger than can
be handled as a String or Buffer in Node.js or node-oracledb, it will need to be
streamed from a [Lob](#lobclass), as discussed later
in [Streams and Lobs](#streamsandlobs).

For example, to make every CLOB queried by the application be returned
as a string:

```javascript
oracledb.fetchAsString = [ oracledb.CLOB ];

conn.execute(
  "SELECT c FROM mylobs WHERE id = 1",
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    if (result.rows.length === 0)
      console.error("No results");
    else {
      var clob = result.rows[0][0];
      console.log(clob);
    }
  });
```

CLOB columns in individual queries can be fetched as strings using `fetchInfo`:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "SELECT c FROM mylobs WHERE id = 1",
  [ ], // no binds
  { fetchInfo: {"C": {type: oracledb.STRING}} },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      console.error("No results");
    }
    else {
      var clob = result.rows[0][0];
      console.log(clob);
    }
  });
```

BLOB query examples are very similar.  To force every BLOB in the
application to be returned as a buffer:

```javascript
oracledb.fetchAsBuffer = [ oracledb.BLOB ];

conn.execute(
  "SELECT b FROM mylobs WHERE id = 2",
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    if (result.rows.length === 0)
      console.error("No results");
    else {
      var blob = result.rows[0][0];
      console.log(blob.toString());  // assuming printable characters
    }
  });
```

BLOB columns in individual queries can be fetched as buffers using `fetchInfo`:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "SELECT b FROM mylobs WHERE id = 2",
  [ ], // no binds
  { fetchInfo: {"B": {type: oracledb.BUFFER}} },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      console.error("No results");
    } else {
      var blob = result.rows[0][0];
      console.log(blob.toString());  // assuming printable characters
    }
  });
```

#### Getting LOBs as String or Buffer from PL/SQL

PL/SQL LOB OUT parameters can be bound as `oracledb.STRING` or
`oracledb.BUFFER`.  See [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds) for size
considerations regarding LOB binds.

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "BEGIN lobs_out(:id, :c, :b); END;",
  { id: 20,
    c: {type: oracledb.STRING, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, maxSize: 50000},
    b: {type: oracledb.BUFFER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, maxSize: 50000} },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { return cb(err, conn); }

    var str = result.outBinds.c;  // a String
    var buf = result.outBinds.b;  // a Buffer
    return cb(null, str, buf); // do something with str and buf
  });
```

The fetched String and Buffer can be used directly in Node.js.

If data to be bound is larger than can be handled as a String or
Buffer in Node.js or node-oracledb, it will need to be explicitly
streamed to a [Lob](#lobclass), as discussed
in [Streams and Lobs](#streamsandlobs).
See [LOB Bind Parameters](#lobbinds) for size considerations regarding
LOB binds.

### <a name="streamsandlobs"></a> 11.3 Streams and Lobs

The [Lob Class](#lobclass) in node-oracledb implements the [Node.js
Stream][16] interface to provide streaming access to CLOB and BLOB
database columns and to PL/SQL bind parameters.

Node-oracledb Lobs can represent persistent LOBs (those permanently
stored in the database) or temporary LOBs (such as those created
with [`connection.createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob), or returned
from some SQL or PL/SQL).

If multiple LOBs are streamed concurrently, worker threads will
effectively be serialized on the connection.

It is the application's responsibility to make sure the connection
remains open while a Stream operation such as `pipe()` is in progress.

#### Readable Lobs

Being a Stream object, a Lob being read from the database has two
modes of operation: "flowing mode" and "paused mode".  In flowing mode,
data is piped to another stream, or events are posted as data is read.
In paused mode the application must explicitly call `read()` to get
data.

The `read(size)` unit is in characters for CLOBs and in bytes for BLOBs.

When reading a LOB from the database, resources are automatically
released at completion of the readable stream or if there is a LOB
error.  The `lob.close()` method can also be used to close persistent
LOBs that have not been streamed to completion.

A Readable Lob object starts out in paused mode.  If a 'data' event
handler is added, or the Lob is piped to a Writeable stream, then the
Lob switches to flowing mode.

For unpiped Readable Lobs operating in flowing mode where the Lob is
read through event handlers, the Lob object can be switched to paused
mode by calling `pause()`.  Once the Lob is in paused mode, it stops
emitting `data` events.

Similarly, a Readable Lob operating in the paused mode can be switched
to flowing mode by calling `resume()`.  It will then start emitting
'data' events again.

#### Writeable Lobs

Lobs are written to with `pipe()`. Alternatively the `write()` method
can be called successively, with the last piece being written by the
`end()` method.  The `end()` method must be called because it frees
resources.  If the Lob is being piped into, then the `write()` and
`end()` methods are automatically called.

Writeable Lobs also have events, see the [Node.js Stream][16]
documentation.

At the conclusion of streaming into a Writeable Lob, the `close` event
will occur.  It is recommended to put logic such as committing and
releasing connections in this event (or after it occurs).  See
[lobinsert2.js][51].  It is also recommended that persistent LOBs not
use the `finish` event handler for cleanup.

### <a name="lobinsertdiscussion"></a> 11.4 Using RETURNING INTO to Insert into LOBs

If Strings or Buffers are too large to be directly inserted into the
database (see [Simple Insertion of LOBs](#basiclobinsert)), use a
`RETURNING INTO` clause to retrieve a [Lob](#lobclass) for a table
item.  Data can then be streamed into the Lob and committed directly
to the table:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO mylobs (id, c) VALUES (:id, EMPTY_CLOB()) RETURNING c INTO :lobbv",
  { id: 4,
    lobbv: {type: oracledb.CLOB, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT} },
  { autoCommit: false },  // a transaction needs to span the INSERT and pipe()
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    if (result.rowsAffected != 1 || result.outBinds.lobbv.length != 1) {
      console.error('Error getting a LOB locator');
      return;
    }

    var lob = result.outBinds.lobbv[0];
    lob.on('close', function() {
        connection.commit(  // all data is loaded so we can commit it
          function(err) {
            if (err) console.error(err.message);
            connection.close(function(err) { if (err) console.error(err); });
          });
      });
    lob.on('error', function(err) {
        console.error(err);
        connection.close(function(err) {
          if (err) console.error(err.message);
        });
      });

    var inStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt'); // open the file to read from
    inStream.on('error', function(err) { if (err) console.error(err); });
    inStream.pipe(lob);  // copies the text to the LOB
  });
```

This example streams from a file into the table.  When the data has
been completely streamed, the Lob is automatically closed and the
'close' event triggered.  At this point the data can be committed.

See [lobinsert2.js][51] for the full example.

### <a name="loboutstream"></a> 11.5 Getting LOBs as Streams from Oracle Database

By default, when a `SELECT` clause contains a LOB column, or a PL/SQL
OUT parameter returns a LOB, instances of [Lob](#lobclass) are
created.  (This can be changed, see [Simple LOB Queries and PL/SQL OUT Binds](#queryinglobs).)

For each Lob instance, the [`lob.type`](#proplobtype) property will
be [`oracledb.BLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype)
or [`oracledb.CLOB`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype), depending on the
column or PL/SQL parameter type.

Returned Lobs can be used as [Readable Streams][16].  Data can be
streamed from each Lob, for example to a file.  At the conclusion of
the stream, persistent LOBs are automatically closed.

Lobs returned from the database that are not streamed can be passed
back to the database as IN binds for PL/SQL blocks, for `INSERT`, or
for `UPDATE` statements.  The Lobs should then be closed
with [`lob.close()`](#lobclose).  If they are passed as IN OUT binds,
they will be automatically closed and the
execution [`outBinds`](#execoutbinds) property will contain the
updated Lob.

#### LOB Query Example

Each CLOB or BLOB in a `SELECT` returns a [Lob](#lobclass) by default.
The table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mylobs (id NUMBER, c CLOB, b BLOB);
```
can be called to get a Lob `clob` like:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "SELECT c FROM mylobs WHERE id = 1",
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
      return cb(err);
    }
    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
      return cb(new Error("whoops"));
    }
    var clob = result.rows[0][0]; // Instance of a node-oracledb Lob
    // console.log(clob.type);    // -> 2006 aka oracledb.CLOB
    cb(null, clob);               // do something with the Lob
  });
```

#### PL/SQL LOB Parameter Fetch Example

A PL/SQL procedure such as this:

```sql
PROCEDURE lobs_out (id IN NUMBER, clob_out OUT CLOB, blob_out OUT BLOB) . . .
```

can be called to get the [Lobs](#lobclass) `clob` and `blob`:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  "BEGIN lobs_out(:id, :c, :b); END;",
  { id: 1,
    c: {type: oracledb.CLOB, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT},
    b: {type: oracledb.BLOB, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT} },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
      return cb(err, conn);
    }

    var clob = result.outBinds.c;
    var blob = result.outBinds.b;
    cb(null, clob, blob);         // do something with the Lobs
  });
```

#### Streaming Out a Lob

Once a Lob is obtained from a query or PL/SQL OUT bind, it can be
streamed out:

```javascript
if (lob === null) {
    // . . . do special handling such as create an empty file or throw an error
}

if (lob.type === oracledb.CLOB) {
  lob.setEncoding('utf8');  // set the encoding so we get a 'string' not a 'buffer'
}

lob.on('error', function(err) { cb(err); });
lob.on('close', function() { cb(null); });   // all done.  The Lob is automatically closed.

var outStream = fs.createWriteStream('myoutput.txt');
outStream.on('error', function(err) { cb(err); });

// switch into flowing mode and push the LOB to myoutput.txt
lob.pipe(outStream);
```

Note the Lob is automatically closed at the end of the stream.

An alternative to the `lob.pipe()` call is to have a `data` event on
the Lob Stream which processes each chunk of LOB data separately.
Either a String or Buffer can be built up or, if the LOB is big, each
chunk can be written to another Stream or to a file:

```javascript
if (lob === null) {
    // . . . do special handling such as create an empty file or throw an error
}

var str = "";

lob.setEncoding('utf8');  // set the encoding so we get a 'string' not a 'buffer'
lob.on('error', function(err) { cb(err); });
lob.on('close', function() { cb(null); });   // all done.  The Lob is automatically closed.
lob.on('data', function(chunk) {
    str += chunk; // or use Buffer.concat() for BLOBS
});
lob.on('end', function() {
    fs.writeFile(..., str, ...);
});

```

Node-oracledb's [`lob.pieceSize`](#proplobpiecesize) can be used to
control the number of bytes retrieved for each readable 'data' event.
This sets the number of bytes (for BLOBs) or characters (for CLOBs).
The default is [`lob.chunkSize`](#proplobchunksize).  The
recommendation is for it to be a multiple of `chunkSize`.

See [lobbinds.js][52] for a full example.

### <a name="templobdiscussion"></a> 11.6 Using `createLob()` for PL/SQL IN Binds

Node-oracledb applications can create Oracle 'temporary LOBs' by
calling [`connection.createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob).  These are
instances of the [Lob](#lobclass) class. They can be populated with
data and passed to PL/SQL blocks.  This is useful if the data is
larger than feasible for direct binding
(see [Simple Insertion of LOBs](#basiclobinsert)).  These Lobs can
also be used for SQL statement IN binds, however the `RETURNING INTO`
method shown above will be more efficient.

Lobs from `createLob()` will use space in the temporary tablespace
until [`lob.close()`](#lobclose) is called.  Database Administrators
can track this usage by querying [`V$TEMPORARY_LOBS`][13].

#### Passing a Lob Into PL/SQL

The following insertion example is based on [lobplsqltemp.js][53].  It
creates an empty LOB, populates it, and then passes it to a PL/SQL
procedure.

A temporary LOB can be created
with [`connection.createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob):

```javascript
conn.createLob(oracledb.CLOB, function(err, templob) {
  if (err) { . . . }

  // ... else use templob
});
```

Once created, data can be inserted into it.  For example to read a
text file:

```javascript
templob.on('error', function(err) { somecallback(err); });

// The data was loaded into the temporary LOB, so use it
templob.on('finish', function() { somecallback(null, templob); });

// copies the text from 'example.txt' to the temporary LOB
var inStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt');
inStream.on('error', function(err) { . . . });
inStream.pipe(templob);
```

Now the LOB has been populated, it can be bound in `somecallback()` to
a PL/SQL IN parameter:

```javascript
// For PROCEDURE lobs_in (p_id IN NUMBER, c_in IN CLOB, b_in IN BLOB)
conn.execute(
  "BEGIN lobs_in(:id, :c, null); END;",
  { id: 3,
    c: templob }, // type and direction are optional for IN binds
  function(err) {
    if (err) { return cb(err); }
    console.log("Call completed");
    return cb(null, conn, templob);
  });
```

When the LOB is no longer needed, it must be closed
with [`lob.close()`](#lobclose):

```javascript
templob.close(function (err) {
  if (err)
    . . .
  else
    // success
});
```

### <a name="closinglobs"></a> 11.7 Closing Lobs

Closing a Lob frees up resources. In particular, the temporary
tablespace storage used by a temporary LOB is released.  Once a Lob is
closed, it can no longer be bound or used for streaming.

Lobs created with [`createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob) should be
explicitly closed with [`lob.close()`](#lobclose).

Persistent or temporary Lobs returned from the database should be
closed with `lob.close()` unless they have been automatically closed.
Automatic closing of returned Lobs occurs when:

- streaming has completed
- a stream error occurs
- the Lob was used as the source for an IN OUT bind

If you try to close a Lob being used for streaming you will get the
error *NJS-023: concurrent operations on a Lob are not allowed*.

The connection must be open when calling `lob.close()` on a temporary
LOB.

The `lob.close()` method emits the [Node.js Stream][16] 'close' event
unless the Lob has already been closed explicitly or automatically.

## <a name="jsondatatype"></a> 12. Oracle Database 12c JSON Data type

Oracle Database 12.1.0.2 introduced native support for JSON data.  You
can use JSON with relational database features, including
transactions, indexing, declarative querying, and views.  You can
project JSON data relationally, making it available for relational
processes and tools.

JSON data in the database is stored as BLOB, CLOB or VARCHAR2 data.
This means that node-oracledb can easily insert and query it.

As an example, the following table has a `PO_DOCUMENT` column that is
enforced to be JSON:

```sql
CREATE TABLE j_purchaseorder (po_document VARCHAR2(4000) CHECK (po_document IS JSON));
```

To insert data using node-oracledb:

```javascript
var data = { "userId": 1, "userName": "Chris", "location": "Australia" };
var s = JSON.stringify(data);  // change JavaScript value to a JSON string

connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO j_purchaseorder (po_document) VALUES (:bv)",
  [s]  // bind the JSON string
  function (err) {
  . . .
  });
```

Queries can access JSON with Oracle JSON path expressions.  These
expressions are matched by Oracle SQL functions and conditions to
select portions of the JSON data.  Path expressions can use wildcards
and array ranges.  An example is `$.friends` which is the value of
JSON field `friends`.

Oracle provides SQL functions and conditions to create, query, and
operate on JSON data stored in the database.

For example, `j_purchaseorder` can be queried with:

```
"SELECT po.po_document.location FROM j_purchaseorder po"
```

With the earlier JSON inserted into the table, the queried value would
be `Australia`.

The `JSON_EXISTS` tests for the existence of a particular value within
some JSON data.  To look for JSON entries that have a `quantity`
field:

```JavaScript
conn.execute(
  "SELECT po_document FROM j_purchaseorder WHERE JSON_EXISTS (po_document, '$.location')",
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
      . . .
    } else {
      var js = JSON.parse(result.rows[0][0]);  // show only first record in this example
      console.log('Query results: ', js);
    }
  });
```

This query would display:

```
{ userId: 1, userName: 'Chris', location: 'Australia' }
```

In Oracle Database 12.2 the [`JSON_OBJECT` ][54] function is a great
way to convert relational table data to JSON:

```javascript
conn.execute(
  `SELECT JSON_OBJECT ('deptId' IS d.department_id, 'name' IS d.department_name) department
  FROM departments d
  WHERE department_id < :did`,
  [50],
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    for (var i = 0; i < result.rows.length; i++)
      console.log(result.rows[i][0]);
  });
```

This produces:

```
{"deptId":10,"name":"Administration"}
{"deptId":20,"name":"Marketing"}
{"deptId":30,"name":"Purchasing"}
{"deptId":40,"name":"Human Resources"}
```

See [selectjson.js][55] and [selectjsonblob.js][56] for runnable
examples.

For more information about using JSON in Oracle Database see the
[Database JSON Developer's Guide]([57]).

## <a name="xmltype"></a> 13. Working with XMLType

`XMLType` columns cannot be queried directly.  Instead, change the SQL
query to return a CLOB, for example

```sql
var sql = 'SELECT XMLTYPE.GETCLOBVAL(res) FROM resource_view';
```

The CLOB can be fetched in node-oracledb as a String
or [Lob](#lobclass).

To insert into an `XMLType` column, directly insert a string
containing the XML, or use a temporary LOB, depending on the data
length.

```javascript
var myxml =
    `<Warehouse>
    <WarehouseId>1</WarehouseId>
    <WarehouseName>Melbourne, Australia</WarehouseName>
    <Building>Owned</Building>
    <Area>2020</Area>
    <Docks>1</Docks>
    <DockType>Rear load</DockType>
    <WaterAccess>false</WaterAccess>
    <RailAccess>N</RailAccess>
    <Parking>Garage</Parking>
    <VClearance>20</VClearance>
    </Warehouse>`;

    connection.execute(
      "INSERT INTO xwarehouses (warehouse_id, warehouse_spec) VALUES (:id, XMLType(:bv))",
      { id: 1, bv: myxml },
      . . .
```

LOB handling as discussed in the
section [Working with CLOB and BLOB Data](#lobhandling).

## <a name="bind"></a> 14. Bind Parameters for Prepared Statements

SQL and PL/SQL statements may contain bind parameters, indicated by
colon-prefixed identifiers or numerals.  These indicate where
separately specified values are substituted in a statement when it is
executed, or where values are to be returned after execution.

IN binds are values passed into the database.  OUT binds are used to
retrieve data.  IN OUT binds are passed in, and may return a different
value after the statement executes.

Using bind parameters is recommended in preference to constructing SQL
or PL/SQL statements by string concatenation or template literals.
This is for performance and security.

Inserted data that is bound is passed to the database separately from
the statement text.  It can never be executed directly.  This means
there is no need to escape bound data inserted into the database.

If a statement is executed more than once with different values for
the bind parameters, then Oracle can re-use context from the initial
execution, generally improving performance.  However, if similar
statements contain hard coded values instead of bind parameters,
Oracle sees the statement text is different and will be less
efficient.

Bind parameters can be used to substitute data but not the text of the
statement.

Bind variables cannot be used in [DDL][15] statements, for example
`CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER` commands.

Sets of values can bound for use in
[`connection.executeMany()`](#executemany), see [Batch Statement
Execution](#batchexecution).

### <a name="inbind"></a> 14.1 IN Bind Parameters

For IN binds, a data value is passed into the database and substituted
into the statement during execution of SQL or PL/SQL.

#### <a name="bindbyname"></a> Bind by Name

To bind data values, the [`bindParams`](#executebindParams) argument
of `execute()` should contain bind variable objects
with
[`dir`](#executebindParams),
[`val`](#executebindParams), [`type`](#executebindParams) properties.
Each bind variable object name must match the statement's bind
parameter name:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
. . .
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO countries VALUES (:country_id, :country_name)",
  {
    country_id: { dir: oracledb.BIND_IN, val: 90, type: oracledb.NUMBER },
    country_name: { dir: oracledb.BIND_IN, val: "Tonga", type:oracledb.STRING }
  },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err)
      console.error(err.message);
    else
      console.log("Rows inserted " + result.rowsAffected);
  });
```

For IN binds:

- The direction `dir` is `oracledb.BIND_IN`, which is the default when `dir`
  is not specified.

- The `val` attribute may be a constant or a JavaScript variable.

- If `type` is omitted, it is inferred from the bind data value.  If
  `type` is set, it can be `oracledb.STRING`, `oracledb.NUMBER`,
  `oracledb.DATE` or `oracledb.BUFFER` matching the standard Node.js
  type of the data being passed into the database.  Use a bind type of
  `oracledb.BLOB` or `oracledb.CLOB` to pass in [Lob](#lobclass)
  instances.  The type `oracledb.BUFFER` can bind a Node.js Buffer to
  an Oracle Database RAW, LONG RAW or BLOB type.

Since `dir` and `type` have defaults, these attributes are sometimes
omitted for IN binds.  Binds can be like:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO countries VALUES (:country_id, :country_name)",
  {country_id: 90, country_name: "Tonga"},
  function(err, result) {
    if (err)
      console.error(err.message);
    else
      console.log("Rows inserted " + result.rowsAffected);
  });
```

When a bind parameter name is used more than once in the SQL statement,
it should only occur once in the bind object:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name = :nmbv OR last_name = :nmbv",
  {nmbv: 'Christopher'},
  function(err, result)
  . . .
```

#### <a name="bindbypos"></a> Bind by Position

Instead of using named bind parameters, the data can alternatively be
in an array.  In this example, values are bound to the SQL bind
parameters `:country_id` and `:country_name`:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO countries VALUES (:country_id, :country_name)",
  [90, "Tonga"],
  function(err, result)
  . . .
```

The position of the array values corresponds to the position of the
SQL bind parameters as they occur in the statement, regardless of their
names.  This is still true even if the bind parameters are named like
`:0`, `:1`, etc.  The following snippet will fail because the country
name needs to be the second entry of the array so it becomes the
second value in the `INSERT` statement

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "INSERT INTO countries (country_id, country_name) VALUES (:1, :0)",
  ["Tonga", 90],  // fail
  . . .
```

In the context of SQL statements, the input array position 'n'
indicates the bind parameter at the n'th position in the
statement. However, in the context of PL/SQL statements the position
'n' in the bind call indicates a binding for the n'th unique parameter
name in the statement when scanned left to right.

If a bind parameter name is repeated in the SQL string
then [bind by name](#bindbyname) syntax should be used.

#### <a name="binddatatypenotes"></a> Bind Data Type Notes

When binding a JavaScript Date value in an `INSERT` statement, it is
inserted as if it represented a TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE value.
In the database, TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE dates are normalized
to the database time zone, or to the time zone specified for TIMESTAMP
WITH TIME ZONE columns.  If later queried, they are returned in the
session time zone.  See [Fetching Date and Timestamps](datehandling)
for more information.

The type `oracledb.CURSOR` cannot be used with IN binds.

Binding NCHAR, NVARCHAR or NCLOB for [DML][14] may result in incorrect
character mapping, depending on the database character set and the
database national character set.  It may work in the case where the
database character set can safely convert to the database national
character set.

### <a name="outbind"></a> 14.2 OUT and IN OUT Bind Parameters

OUT binds are used to retrieve data from the database.  IN OUT binds
are passed in, and may return a different value after the statement
executes.  IN OUT binds can be used for PL/SQL calls, but not for SQL.

For each OUT and IN OUT bind parameter
in [`bindParams`](#executebindParams), a bind variable object
containing
[`dir`](#executebindParams),
[`val`](#executebindParams), [`type`](#executebindParams),
and [`maxSize`](#executebindParams) properties is used:

- The `dir` attribute should be `oracledb.BIND_OUT` or
  `oracledb.BIND_INOUT`, depending on whether data is only to be
  returned from the database or additionally passed into the
  database.

- The `val` parameter in needed when binding IN OUT to pass a value
  into the database.  It is not used for OUT binds.

- For `oracledb.BIND_INOUT` parameters, the `type` attribute is
  inferred from the input data type.  Alternatively it can be
  explicitly set to `oracledb.STRING`, `oracledb.NUMBER`,
  `oracledb.DATE`, `oracledb.BLOB`, `oracledb.CLOB` or
  `oracledb.BUFFER`, matching the data type of the Node.js value or
  variable.  The output data type will always be the same as the
  input data type.

  For `oracledb.BIND_OUT` parameters the `type` attribute will be the
  node-oracledb or Node.js data type that data will be returned as.
  It should be `oracledb.STRING`, `oracledb.NUMBER`, `oracledb.DATE`,
  `oracledb.BUFFER`, `oracledb.CURSOR`, `oracledb.BLOB`, or
  `oracledb.CLOB`.  If `type` is not specified for OUT binds then
  `oracledb.STRING` is assumed.

  Oracle Database CLOB data can be bound with a `type` of
  `oracledb.STRING` to return a Node.js String, or as `type` of
  `oracledb.CLOB` to return a [Lob instance](#lobclass).

  Oracle Database BLOB data can be bound with a `type` of
  `oracledb.BUFFER` to return a Node.js Buffer, or as `type` of
  `oracledb.BLOB` to return a [Lob instance](#lobclass).

  Oracle Database RAW and LONG RAW data can be bound with a
  `type` of `oracledb.BUFFER` to return a Node.js Buffer.

  Oracle Database LONG, ROWID and UROWID data can be bound with a
  `type` of `oracledb.STRING` to return a JavaScript String.

- A `maxSize` attribute should be set for `oracledb.STRING` or
  `oracledb.BUFFER` OUT or IN OUT binds.  This is the maximum number
  of bytes the bind parameter will return.  If the output value does
  not fit in `maxSize` bytes, then an error such *ORA-06502: PL/SQL:
  numeric or value error: character string buffer too small* or
  *NJS-016: buffer is too small for OUT binds* occurs.

  A default value of 200 bytes is used when `maxSize` is not provided
  for OUT binds of type `oracledb.STRING` or `oracledb.BUFFER`.

  A string representing a UROWID may be up to 5267 bytes long in
  node-oracledb.

For [PL/SQL Associative Array binds](#plsqlindexbybinds)
a [`maxArraySize`](#executebindParams) property is also required

#### <a name="outbinds"></a> Accessing OUT Bind Values

The [`results`](#executecallback) parameter of the `execute()`
callback contains an [`outBinds`](#execoutbinds) property with the
returned OUT and IN OUT bind values.

Given the creation of the PL/SQL procedure `TESTPROC`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE testproc (
p_in IN VARCHAR2, p_inout IN OUT VARCHAR2, p_out OUT NUMBER)
AS
BEGIN
  p_inout := p_in || p_inout;
  p_out := 101;
END;
/
show errors
```

The procedure `TESTPROC` can be called with:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
. . .
var bindVars = {
  i:  'Chris', // default direction is BIND_IN. Data type is inferred from the data
  io: { val: 'Jones', dir: oracledb.BIND_INOUT },
  o:  { dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, type: oracledb.NUMBER },
}
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN testproc(:i, :io, :o); END;",
  bindVars,
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  });
```

Since `bindParams` is passed as an object, the `outBinds` property is
also an object.  The Node.js output is:

```
{ io: 'ChrisJones', o: 101 }
```

PL/SQL allows named parameters in procedure and function calls.  This
can be used in `execute()` like:

```
  "BEGIN testproc(p_in => :i, p_inout => :io, p_out => :o); END;",
```

An alternative to node-oracledb's 'bind by name' syntax is 'bind by array' syntax:

```javascript
var bindVars = [
  'Chris',
  { val: 'Jones', dir: oracledb.BIND_INOUT },
  { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT }
];
```

When [`bindParams`](#executebindParams) is passed as an array, then
`outBinds` is returned as an array, with the same order as the OUT
binds in the statement:

```
[ 'ChrisJones', 101 ]
```

Mixing positional and named syntax is not supported.  The following
will throw an error:

```javascript
var bindVars = [
  'Chris',                                                  // valid
  { val: 'Jones', dir: oracledb.BIND_INOUT },               // valid
  { o: { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT } }  // invalid
];
```

### <a name="dmlreturn"></a> 14.3 DML RETURNING Bind Parameters

[DML][14] statements query or manipulate data in existing schema
objects.

Bind parameters from "DML RETURNING" statements (such as `INSERT
... RETURNING ... INTO ...`) can use `oracledb.BLOB`, `oracledb.CLOB`, `oracledb.STRING`,
`oracledb.NUMBER` or `oracledb.DATE` for the OUT [`type`](#executebindParams).

For `oracledb.STRING` types, an error occurs if [`maxSize`](#executebindParams)
is not large enough to hold a returned value.

Note each DML RETURNING bind OUT parameter is returned as an array
containing zero or more elements.  Application code that is designed
to expect only one value could be made more robust if it confirms the
returned array length is not greater than one.  This will help identify
invalid data or an incorrect `WHERE` clause that causes more results
to be returned.

Oracle Database DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE
and TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE types can be bound as `oracledb.DATE` for DML
RETURNING.  These types can also be bound as `oracledb.STRING`, if desired.
ROWID and UROWID data to be returned can be bound as `oracledb.STRING`.
Note that a string representing a UROWID may be up to 5267 bytes
long.

No duplicate binds are allowed in a DML statement with a `RETURNING`
clause, and no duplication is allowed between bind parameters in the
DML section and the `RETURNING` section of the statement.

One common use case is to return an 'auto incremented' key values, see
[Auto-Increment Columns](#autoincrement).

An example of DML RETURNING binds is:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
. . .
connection.execute(
   "UPDATE mytab SET name = :name "
 + "WHERE id = :id "
 + "RETURNING id, ROWID INTO :ids, :rids",
  {
    id:    1001,
    name:  "Krishna",
    ids:   { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT },
    rids:  { type: oracledb.STRING, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT }
  },
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  });
```

If the `WHERE` clause matches one record, the output would be like:

```
{ ids: [ 1001 ], rids: [ 'AAAbvZAAMAAABtNAAA' ] }
```

When a couple of rows match, the output could be:

```
{ ids: [ 1001, 1002 ],
  rids: [ 'AAAbvZAAMAAABtNAAA', 'AAAbvZAAMAAABtNAAB' ] }
```

If the `WHERE` clause matches no rows, the output would be:

```
{ ids: [], rids: [] }
```

### <a name="refcursors"></a> 14.4 REF CURSOR Bind Parameters

Oracle REF CURSORS can be fetched in node-oracledb by binding a
`oracledb.CURSOR` to a PL/SQL call.  The resulting bind variable becomes a
[ResultSet](#resultsetclass), allowing rows to be fetched using
[`getRow()`](#getrow) or [`getRows()`](#getrows).  The ResultSet can
also be converted to a Readable Stream by using
[`toQueryStream()`](#toquerystream).

If using `getRow()` or `getRows()` the ResultSet must be freed using
[`close()`](#close) when all rows have been fetched, or when the
application does not want to continue getting more rows.  If the REF
CURSOR is set to NULL or is not set in the PL/SQL procedure then the
returned ResultSet is invalid and methods like `getRows()` will
return an error when invoked.

Given a PL/SQL procedure defined as:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_emp_rs (
  p_sal IN NUMBER,
  p_recordset OUT SYS_REFCURSOR) AS
BEGIN
  OPEN p_recordset FOR
    SELECT first_name, salary, hire_date
    FROM   employees
    WHERE  salary > p_sal;
END;
/
```

This PL/SQL procedure can be called in node-oracledb using:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

var numRows = 10;  // number of rows to return from each call to getRows()

var plsql = "BEGIN get_emp_rs(:sal, :cursor); END;";
var bindvars = {
  sal:  6000,
  cursor:  { type: oracledb.CURSOR, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT }
}

connection.execute(
  plsql,
  bindvars,
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { . . . }
    fetchRowsFromRS(connection, result.outBinds.cursor, numRows);
  });

function fetchRowsFromRS(connection, resultSet, numRows) {
  resultSet.getRows( // get numRows rows
    numRows,
    function (err, rows) {
      if (err) {
         . . .                        // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      } else if (rows.length > 0) {   // got some rows
        console.log(rows);            // process rows
        if (rows.length === numRows)  // might be more rows
          fetchRowsFromRS(connection, resultSet, numRows);
        else                          // got fewer rows than requested so must be at end
          . . .                       // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      } else {                        // else no rows
          . . .                       // close the ResultSet and release the connection
      }
    });
}
```

See [refcursor.js][40] for a complete example.

To convert the REF CURSOR ResultSet to a stream, use
[`toQueryStream()`](#toquerystream).  With the PL/SQL and bind values
from the previous examples, the code would become:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  plsql,
  bindvars,
  function(err, result) {
    if (err) { . . . }
    fetchRCFromStream(connection, result.outBinds.cursor);
  });

function fetchRCFromStream(connection, cursor) {
  var stream = cursor.toQueryStream();

  stream.on('error', function (error) {
    // console.log("stream 'error' event");
    console.error(error);
    return;
  });

  stream.on('metadata', function (metadata) {
    // console.log("stream 'metadata' event");
    console.log(metadata);
  });

  stream.on('data', function (data) {
    // console.log("stream 'data' event");
    console.log(data);
  });

  stream.on('end', function () {
    // console.log("stream 'end' event");
    connection.release(
      function(err) {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err.message);
        }
      });
  });
}
```

The connection must remain open until the stream is completely read.
Query results must be fetched to completion to avoid resource leaks.
The ResultSet `close()` call for streaming query results will be
executed internally when all data has been fetched.

### <a name="lobbinds"></a> 14.5 LOB Bind Parameters

Database CLOBs can be bound with `type` set
to [`oracledb.CLOB`](#oracledbconstants).  Database BLOBs can be bound
as [`oracledb.BLOB`](#oracledbconstants).  These binds accept, or
return, node-oracledb [Lob](#lobclass) instances, which implement the
Node.js Stream interface.

Lobs may represent Oracle Database persistent LOBs (those stored in
tables) or temporary LOBs (such as those created
with [`createLob()`](#connectioncreatelob) or returned by some SQL and
PL/SQL operations).

LOBs can be bound with direction `oracledb.BIND_IN`, `oracledb.BIND_OUT` or
`oracledb.BIND_INOUT`, depending on context.

Note that any PL/SQL OUT LOB parameter should be initialized in the
PL/SQL block - even just to NULL - before the PL/SQL code
completes. Make sure to do this in all PL/SQL code paths including in
error handlers. This prevents node-oracledb throwing the error
*DPI-007: invalid OCI handle or descriptor*.

In many cases it will be easier to work with JavaScript Strings and
Buffers instead of [Lobs](#lobclass).  These types can be bound
directly for SQL IN binds to insert into, or update, LOB columns.
They can also be bound to PL/SQL LOB parameters.  Use the bind
type [`oracledb.STRING`](#oracledbconstants) for CLOBs
and [`oracledb.BUFFER`](#oracledbconstants) for BLOBs.  The default
size used for these binds in the OUT direction is 200, so set
`maxSize` appropriately.

See [Working with CLOB and BLOB Data](#lobhandling) for examples and
more information on binding and working with LOBs.

#### Size Limits for Binding LOBs to Strings and Buffers

When CLOBs are bound as `oracledb.STRING`, or BLOBs are bound as
`oracledb.BUFFER`, the limitation on binding is the memory available
to Node.js and the V8 engine.  For data larger than several megabytes,
it is recommended to bind as `oracledb.CLOB` or `oracledb.BLOB` and
use [Lob streaming](#streamsandlobs).  If you try to create large
Strings or Buffers in Node.js you will see errors like *JavaScript
heap out of memory*, or other space related messages.

Internally, temporary LOBs are used when binding Strings and Buffers
larger than 32 KB for PL/SQL calls.  Freeing of the temporary LOB is
handled automatically.  For SQL calls no temporary LOBs are used.

### <a name="plsqlindexbybinds"></a> 14.6 PL/SQL Collection Associative Array (Index-by) Bind Parameters

Arrays of strings and numbers can be bound to PL/SQL IN, IN OUT, and
OUT parameters of PL/SQL INDEX BY associative array type.  This type
was formerly called PL/SQL tables or index-by tables.  This method of
binding can be a very efficient way of transferring small data sets to
PL/SQL.  Note PL/SQL's VARRAY and nested table collection types cannot
be bound.

Given this table and PL/SQL package:

```sql
DROP TABLE mytab;
CREATE TABLE mytab (id NUMBER, numcol NUMBER);

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE mypkg IS
  TYPE numtype IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
  PROCEDURE myinproc(p_id IN NUMBER, vals IN numtype);
  PROCEDURE myoutproc(p_id IN NUMBER, vals OUT numtype);
END;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY mypkg IS

  PROCEDURE myinproc(p_id IN NUMBER, vals IN numtype) IS
  BEGIN
    FORALL i IN INDICES OF vals
      INSERT INTO mytab (id, numcol) VALUES (p_id, vals(i));
  END;

  PROCEDURE myoutproc(p_id IN NUMBER, vals OUT numtype) IS
  BEGIN
    SELECT numcol BULK COLLECT INTO vals FROM mytab WHERE id = p_id ORDER BY 1;
  END;

END;
/
```

To bind an array in node-oracledb using "bind by name" syntax for insertion into `mytab` use:

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN mypkg.myinproc(:id, :vals); END;",
  {
    id: 1234,
    vals: { type: oracledb.NUMBER,
             dir: oracledb.BIND_IN,
             val: [1, 2, 23, 4, 10]
          }
  }, . . .
```

Alternatively, "bind by position" syntax can be used:

 ```javascript
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN mypkg.myinproc(:id, :vals); END;",
  [
    1234,
    { type: oracledb.NUMBER,
       dir: oracledb.BIND_IN,
       val: [1, 2, 23, 4, 10]
    }
  ],

  function (err) { . . . });
```

After executing either of these `mytab` will contain:

```
    ID         NUMCOL
---------- ----------
      1234          1
      1234          2
      1234         23
      1234          4
      1234         10
```

The [`type`](#executebindParams) must be set for PL/SQL array binds.
It can be set to [`oracledb.STRING`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype) or [`oracledb.NUMBER`](#oracledbconstantsnodbtype).

For OUT and IN OUT binds, the [`maxArraySize`](#executebindParams)
bind property must be set.  Its value is the maximum number of
elements that can be returned in an array.  An error will occur if the
PL/SQL block attempts to insert data beyond this limit.  If the PL/SQL
code returns fewer items, the JavaScript array will have the actual
number of data elements and will not contain null entries.  Setting
`maxArraySize` larger than needed will cause unnecessary memory
allocation.

For IN OUT binds, `maxArraySize` can be greater than the number of
elements in the input array.  This allows more values to be returned
than are passed in.

For IN binds, `maxArraySize` is ignored, as also is `maxSize`.

For `oracledb.STRING` IN OUT or OUT binds, the string length
[`maxSize`](#executebindParams) property may be set.  If it is not set
the memory allocated per string will default to 200 bytes.  If the
value is not large enough to hold the longest string data item in the
collection a runtime error occurs.  To avoid unnecessary memory
allocation, do not let the size be larger than needed.

The next example fetches an array of values from a table.  First,
insert these values:

```sql
INSERT INTO mytab (id, numcol) VALUES (99, 10);
INSERT INTO mytab (id, numcol) VALUES (99, 25);
INSERT INTO mytab (id, numcol) VALUES (99, 50);
COMMIT;
```

With these values, the following node-oracledb code will print
`[ 10, 25, 50 ]`.

```javascript
connection.execute(
  "BEGIN mypkg.myoutproc(:id, :vals); END;",
  {
    id: 99,
    vals: { type: oracledb.NUMBER,
            dir:  oracledb.BIND_OUT,
            maxArraySize: 10          // allocate memory to hold 10 numbers
        }
  },
  function (err, result) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return; }
    console.log(result.outBinds.vals);
  });
```

If `maxArraySize` was reduced to `2`, the script would fail with:

```
ORA-06513: PL/SQL: index for PL/SQL table out of range for host language array
```

See [Oracledb Constants](#oracledbconstants) and
[execute(): Bind Parameters](#executebindParams) for more information
about binding.

See [plsqlarray.js][58] for a runnable example.

### <a name="sqlwherein"></a> 14.7 Binding Multiple Values to a SQL `WHERE IN` Clause

Binding a single JavaScript value into a SQL `WHERE IN` clause is easy:

```javascript
sql = 'SELECT last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name IN (:bv)';
binds = ['Christopher'];
connection.execute(sql, binds, function(...));
```

But a common use case for a query `WHERE IN` clause is for multiple
values, for example when a web user selects multiple check-box options
and the query should match all chosen values.

Trying to associate multiple data values with a single bind parameter
won't work.  To use a fixed, small number of values in an `WHERE IN`
bind clause, the SQL query should have individual bind parameters, for
example:

```javascript
sql = 'SELECT last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name IN (:bv1, :bv2, :bv3, :bv4)';
binds = ['Alyssa', 'Christopher', 'Hazel', 'Samuel'];
connection.execute(sql, binds, function(...));
```


If you sometimes execute the query with a smaller number of items, a
null can be bound for the 'missing' values:

```javascript
binds = ['Alyssa', 'Christopher', 'Hazel', null];
```

When the exact same statement text is re-executed many times
regardless of the number of user supplied values, you get performance
and scaling benefits from not having multiple, unique SQL statements
being run.

Another solution when the number of data items is only known at
runtime is to build up an exact SQL string like:

```javascript
binds = ['Christopher', 'Hazel', 'Samuel'];
sql = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name IN (";
for (var i=0; i < binds.length; i++)
   sql += (i > 0) ? ", :" + i : ":" + i;
sql += ")";
```

This will construct a SQL statement:

```
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE first_name IN (:0, :1, :2)
```

Binds are still used for security.  But, depending how often this
query is executed, and how changeable the number of bind values is,
you can end up with lots of 'unique' query strings being executed.
You might not get the statement caching benefits that re-executing a
fixed SQL statement would have.

Another solution for a larger number of values is to construct a SQL
statement like:

```
SELECT ... WHERE col IN ( <something that returns a list of rows> )
```

The easiest way to do the `<something that returns a list of rows>`
will depend on how the data is initially represented and the number of
items.  You might look at using `CONNECT BY` or nested tables.  Or,
for really large numbers of items, you might prefer to use a global
temporary table.  Some solutions are given in [On Cursors, SQL, and
Analytics][59] and in [this StackOverflow answer][60].

## <a name="batchexecution"></a> 15. Batch Statement Execution

The [`connection.executeMany()`](#executemany) method allows many sets
of data values to be bound to one DML or PL/SQL statement for
execution.  It is like calling [`connection.execute()`](#execute)
multiple times but requires fewer round-trips.  This is an efficient
way to handle batch changes, for example when inserting or updating
multiple rows.  The method cannot be used for queries.

The `executeMany()` method supports IN, IN OUT and OUT binds for most
data types except [PL/SQL Collection Associative
Arrays](#plsqlindexbybinds).

There are runnable examples in the GitHub [examples][3] directory.

For example, to insert three records into the database:

```javascript
var sql = "INSERT INTO mytab VALUES (:a, :b)";

var binds = [
  { a: 1, b: "One" },
  { a: 2, b: "Two" },
  { a: 3, b: "Three" }
];

var options = {
  autoCommit: true,
  bindDefs: {
    a: { type: oracledb.NUMBER },
    b: { type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 5 }
  } };

connection.executeMany(sql, binds, options, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log(result);  // { rowsAffected: 3 }
  }
});
```

Strings and Buffers require a `maxSize` value in `bindDefs`.  It must
be the length (or greater) of the longest data value.  For efficiency,
keep the size as small as possible.

The [`options`](#executemanyoptions) parameter is optional.

If [`bindDefs`](#executemanyoptbinddefs) is not set, then the bind
direction is assumed to be IN, and the [bind data](#executemanybinds)
are used to determine the bind variable types, names and maximum
sizes.  Using `bindDefs` is generally recommended because it removes
the overhead of scanning all records.

The bind definitions `bindDefs` can also use "bind by position"
syntax, see the next examples.

#### Identifying Affected Rows

When executing a DML statement the number of database rows affected
for each input record can be shown by setting
[`dmlRowCounts`](#execmanydmlrowscounts).  For example when deleting
rows:

```javascript
const sql = "DELETE FROM tab WHERE id = :1";

const binds = [
  [20],
  [30],
  [40]
];

const options = { dmlRowCounts: true };

connection.executeMany(sql, binds, options, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log(result.dmlRowCounts);
  }
});
```

If the table originally contained three rows with id of 20, five rows
with id of 30 and six rows with id of 40, then the output would be:

```
[ 3, 5, 6 ]
```


#### Handling Data Errors

With large sets of data, it can be helpful not to abort processing on
the first data error, but to continue processing and resolve the
errors later.

When [`batchErrors`](#executemanyoptbatcherrors) is *true*, processing
will continue even if there are data errors in some records.  The
`executeMany()` callback error parameter is not set.  Instead, an
array containing each error will be returned in the callback `result`
parameter.  All valid data records will be processed and a transaction
will be started but not committed, even if `autoCommit` is *true*.
The application can examine the errors, take action, and explicitly
commit or rollback, as desired.

For example:

```
var sql = "INSERT INTO childtab VALUES (:1, :2, :3)";

var binds = [
  [1016, 10, "Child 2 of Parent A"],
  [1017, 10, "Child 3 of Parent A"],
  [1018, 20, "Child 4 of Parent B"],
  [1018, 20, "Child 4 of Parent B"],   // duplicate key
  [1019, 30, "Child 3 of Parent C"],
  [1020, 40, "Child 4 of Parent D"],
  [1021, 75, "Child 1 of Parent F"],   // parent does not exist
  [1022, 40, "Child 6 of Parent D"]
];

var options = {
  autoCommit: true,
  batchErrors: true,
  bindDefs: [
    { type: oracledb.NUMBER },
    { type: oracledb.NUMBER },
    { type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 20 }
  ]
};

connection.executeMany(sql, binds, options, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log(result.batchErrors);
  }
});
```

The output is an array of [error objects](#errorobj) that were
reported during execution.  The `offset` property corresponds to the
0-based index of the `executeMany()` [binds
parameter](#executemanybinds) array, indicating which record could
not be processed:

```
   [ { Error: ORA-00001: unique constraint (CJ.CHILDTAB_PK) violated errorNum: 1, offset: 3 },
     { Error: ORA-02291: integrity constraint (CJ.CHILDTAB_FK) violated - parent key not found errorNum: 2291, offset: 6 } ]
```

Note that some classes of error will always return via the
`executeMany()` callback error object, not as batch errors.  No
transaction is created in this case.  This includes errors where
string or buffer data is larger than the specified
[`maxSize`](#executemanyoptbinddefs) value.

#### DML RETURNING

Values can be returned with DML RETURNING syntax:

```
var sql = "INSERT INTO tab VALUES (:1) RETURNING ROWID INTO :2";

var binds = [
  ["One"],
  ["Two"],
  ["Three"]
];

var options = {
  bindDefs: [
    { type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 5 },
    { type: oracledb.STRING, maxSize: 18, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT  },
  ]
};

connection.executeMany(sql, binds, options, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  }
});
```

Output is:

```
[ [ [ 'AAAmI9AAMAAAAnVAAA' ] ],
  [ [ 'AAAmI9AAMAAAAnVAAB' ] ],
  [ [ 'AAAmI9AAMAAAAnVAAC' ] ] ]
```

#### Calling PL/SQL

The `executeMany()` method can be used to execute a PL/SQL statement
multiple times with different input values.  For example, the
following PL/SQL procedure:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE testproc (
  a_num IN NUMBER,
  a_outnum OUT NUMBER,
  a_outstr OUT VARCHAR2)
AS
BEGIN
  a_outnum := a_num * 2;
  FOR i IN 1..a_num LOOP
    a_outstr := a_outstr || 'X';
  END LOOP;
END;
/
```

can be called like:

```javascript
var sql = "BEGIN testproc(:1, :2, :3); END;";

// IN binds
var binds = [
  [1],
  [2],
  [3],
  [4]
];

var options = {
  bindDefs: [
    { type: oracledb.NUMBER },
    { type: oracledb.NUMBER, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT },
    { type: oracledb.STRING, dir: oracledb.BIND_OUT, maxSize: 20 }
  ]
};

connection.executeMany(sql, binds, options, function (err, result) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err)
  } else {
    console.log(result.outBinds);
  }
});
```

The returned bind values are:

```
[ [ 2, 'X' ],
  [ 4, 'XX' ],
  [ 6, 'XXX' ],
  [ 8, 'XXXX' ] ]
```

## <a name="transactionmgt"></a> 16. Transaction Management

By default, [DML][14] statements are not committed in node-oracledb.

The node-oracledb add-on implements [`commit()`](#commit) and
[`rollback()`](#rollback) methods that can be used to explicitly
control transactions.

If the [`autoCommit`](#propdbisautocommit) flag is set to *true*,
then a commit occurs at the end of each `execute()` call.  Unlike an
explicit `commit()`, this does not require a round-trip to the
database.  For maximum efficiency, set `autoCommit` to *true* for the
last `execute()` call of a transaction in preference to using an
additional, explicit `commit()` call.

When a connection is released, any ongoing transaction will be rolled
back.  Therefore if a released, pooled connection is re-used by a
subsequent [`pool.getConnection()`](#getconnectionpool) call
(or [`oracledb.getConnection()`](#getconnectiondb) call that uses a
pool), then any DML statements performed on the obtained connection are
always in a new transaction.

When an application ends, any uncommitted transaction on a connection
will be rolled back.

Note: Oracle Database will implicitly commit when a [DDL][15]
statement is executed irrespective of the value of `autoCommit`.

## <a name="stmtcache"></a> 17. Statement Caching

Node-oracledb's [`execute()`](#execute) and
[`queryStream()`](#querystream) methods use the [Oracle Call Interface
statement cache][61] to make re-execution of statements efficient.
This cache removes the need for the separate 'prepare' or 'parse'
method which is sometimes seen in other Oracle APIs: there is no
separate method in node-oracledb.

Each non-pooled connection and each session in the connection pool has
its own cache of statements with a default size of 30.  Statement
caching lets cursors be used without re-parsing the statement.
Statement caching also reduces meta data transfer costs between the
node-oracledb and the database.  Performance and scalability are
improved.

In general, set the statement cache to the size of the working set of
statements being executed by the application.

Statement caching can be disabled by setting the size to 0.  Disabling
the cache may be beneficial when the quantity or order of statements
causes cache entries to be flushed before they get a chance to be
reused.  For example if there are more distinct statements than cache
slots, and the order of statement execution causes older statements to
be flushed from the cache before the statements are re-executed.

The statement cache size can be set globally with [stmtCacheSize](#propdbstmtcachesize):

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');
oracledb.stmtCacheSize = 40;
```

The value can be overridden in an `oracledb.getConnection()` call:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE",
    stmtCacheSize : 40
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    . . .
  });
```

The value can also be overridden in the `poolAttrs` parameter to
the [`createPool()`](#createpool) method.

With Oracle Database 12c, the statement cache size can be automatically tuned with the
[External Configuration](#oraaccess) *oraaccess.xml* file.

To manually tune the statement cache size, monitor general application
load and the [AWR][62] "bytes sent via SQL*Net to client" values.  The
latter statistic should benefit from not shipping statement metadata
to node-oracledb.  Adjust the statement cache size to your
satisfaction.

## <a name="oraaccess"></a> 18. External Configuration

The optional Oracle client-side configuration file [oraaccess.xml][63]
can be used to configure some behaviors of node-oracledb.  See
[Optional Client Configuration Files](#tnsadmin) for information about
file creation..

An oraaccess.xml file is only used when node-oracledb is linked with
Oracle Database 12c client libraries.

The following oraaccess.xml file sets the Oracle client
['prefetch'][79] value to 100 rows.  This value affects every SQL
query in the application:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <oraaccess xmlns="http://xmlns.oracle.com/oci/oraaccess"
  xmlns:oci="http://xmlns.oracle.com/oci/oraaccess"
  schemaLocation="http://xmlns.oracle.com/oci/oraaccess
  http://xmlns.oracle.com/oci/oraaccess.xsd">
  <default_parameters>
    <prefetch>
      <rows>100</rows>
    </prefetch>
  </default_parameters>
</oraaccess>
```

Prefetching is the number of additional rows the underlying Oracle
client library fetches whenever node-oracledb requests query data from
the database.  Prefetching is a tuning option to maximize data
transfer efficiency and minimize round-trips to the database.  The
prefetch size does not affect when, or how many, rows are returned by
node-oracledb to the application.  The cache management is
transparently handled by the Oracle client libraries. Note, standard
node-oracledb fetch tuning is via
[`fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize), but changing the prefetch
value can be useful in some cases such as when modifying the
application is not feasible.

The oraaccess.xml file has other uses including:

- Turning on [Fast Application Notification (FAN)](#connectionfan) events to enable FAN notifications and [Runtime Load Balancing (RLB)](#connectionrlb).
- Configuring [Client Result Caching][66] parameters
- Turning on [Client Statement Cache Auto-tuning][67]

Refer to the [oraaccess.xml documentation][63].

## <a name="nls"></a> 19. Globalization and National Language Support (NLS)

Node-oracledb can use Oracle's [National Language Support (NLS)][68]
to assist in globalizing applications.

Node-oracledb always uses Oracle's AL32UTF8 character set internally.
Data will be converted between AL32UTF8 and the
database character set when it is inserted into, or queried from, the
database.  The environment variable `NLS_LANG` can be used to
configure the Oracle client language and territory only.

Oracle NLS environment variables, or statements like `ALTER SESSION`,
can be used to configure further aspects of node-oracledb data access
globalization. Examples are `NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS` (discussed in
[Fetching Numbers](#numberhandling)), and `NLS_DATE_FORMAT` (discussed
in [Fetching Numbers and Dates as String](#fetchasstringhandling)).
Refer to [NLS Documentation][69] for others.

## <a name="endtoend"></a> 20. End-to-end Tracing, Mid-tier Authentication, and Auditing

The Connection properties [action](#propconnaction),
[module](#propconnmodule), and [clientId](#propconnclientid) set
metadata for [end-to-end tracing][70].  The values can be tracked in
database views, shown in audit trails, and seen in tools such as
Enterprise Manager.

The `clientId` property can also be used by applications that do their
own mid-tier authentication but connect to the database using the one
database schema.  By setting `clientId` to the application's
authenticated username, the database is aware of who the actual end
user is.  This can, for example, be used by Oracle [Virtual Private
Database][11] policies to automatically restrict data access by that
user.

Applications should set the properties because they can greatly help
to identify and resolve unnecessary database resource usage, or
improper access.

The attributes are set on a [connection](#propdbconclass) object and
sent to the database on the next round-trip from node-oracledb, for
example, with `execute()`:

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/orclpdb"
  },
  function(err, connection) {
    if (err) { console.error(err.message); return;    }

    connection.clientId = "Chris";
    connection.module = "End-to-end example";
    connection.action = "Query departments";

    connection.execute("SELECT . . .",
      function(err, result) {
        . . .
```

While the connection is open the attribute values can be seen, for example with SQL*Plus:

```
SQL> SELECT username, client_identifier, action, module FROM v$session WHERE username = 'HR';

USERNAME   CLIENT_IDENTIFIER    ACTION               MODULE
---------- -------------------- -------------------- --------------------
HR         Chris                Query departments    End-to-end example
```

The values can also be manually set by calling
[`DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO`][71] procedures or
[`DBMS_SESSION.SET_IDENTIFIER`][72], however these cause explicit
round-trips, reducing scalability.

In general, applications should be consistent about how, and when,
they set the end-to-end tracing attributes so that current values are
recorded by the database.

Idle connections released back to a connection pool will retain the
previous attribute values of that connection. This avoids the overhead
of a round-trip to reset the values.  The Oracle design assumption is
that pools are actively used and have few idle connections. After
getting a connection from a pool, an application that uses end-to-end
tracing should set new values appropriately.

When a Connection object is displayed, such as with `console.log()`,
the end-to-end tracing attributes will show as `null` even if values
have been set and are being sent to the database.  This is for
architectural, efficiency and consistency reasons.  When an already
established connection is retrieved from a local pool, node-oracledb
is not able to efficiently retrieve values previously established in
the connection.  The same occurs if the values are set by a call to
PL/SQL code - there is no efficient way for node-oracledb to know the
values have changed.

The attribute values are commonly useful to DBAs.  However, if knowing
the current values is useful in an application, the application should
save the values as part of its application state whenever the
node-oracledb attributes are set.  Applications can also find the
current values by querying the Oracle data dictionary or using PL/SQL
procedures such as `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.READ_MODULE()` with the
understanding that these require round-trips to the database.

#### The Add-on Name

The Oracle Database `V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO` view shows the version of
node-oracledb in use.  This allows DBAs to verify that applications
are using the desired add-on version.  For example, a DBA might see:

```
SQL> SELECT UNIQUE sid, client_driver
     FROM v$session_connect_info
     WHERE client_driver LIKE 'node-oracledb%'
     ORDER BY sid;

       SID CLIENT_DRIVER
---------- ------------------------------
        16 node-oracledb : 2.2.0
        33 node-oracledb : 2.2.0
```

Note if [`oracledb.connectionClass`](#propdbconclass) is set for a
non-pooled connection, the `CLIENT_DRIVER` value will not be set for
that connection.

## <a name="promiseoverview"></a> 21. Promises and node-oracledb

Node-oracledb supports Promises with all asynchronous methods.  The native Promise
implementation is used.

If an asynchronous method is invoked without a callback, it returns a
Promise:

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  })
  .then(function(conn) {
    return conn.execute(
      `SELECT department_id, department_name
       FROM departments
       WHERE manager_id < :id`,
      [110]  // bind value for :id
    )
      .then(function(result) {
        console.log(result.rows);
        return conn.close();
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        console.error(err);
        return conn.close();
      });
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

With Oracle's sample HR schema, the output is:

```
[ [ 60, 'IT' ], [ 90, 'Executive' ], [ 100, 'Finance' ] ]
```

Notice there are two promise "chains": one to get a connection and the
other to use it.  This is required because it is only possible to
refer to the connection within the function to which it was passed.

When invoking asynchronous methods, it is possible to accidentally
get a Promise by forgetting to pass a callback function:

```javascript
oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/WRONG_SERVICE_NAME"
  });
  . . .
```

Since the returned promise will not have a catch block, as the
developer intended to use the callback programming style, any
rejections that occur will go unnoticed.  Node.js 4.0 added the
`unhandledRejection` event to prevent such rejections from going
unnoticed:

```javascript
process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, p) => {
  console.error("Unhandled Rejection at: ", p, " reason: ", reason);
  // application specific logging, throwing an error, or other logic here
});

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/WRONG_SERVICE_NAME"
  });
  . . .
```

Whereas the code without the `unhandledRejection` exception silently
exited, adding the handler could, for example, show:

```
$ node myapp.js
Unhandled Rejection at:  Promise {
  <rejected> [Error: ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor
] }  reason:  [Error: ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor
]
```

For more information, see [How to get, use, and close a DB connection
using promises][73].

### <a name="custompromises"></a> 21.1 Custom Promise Libraries

The Promise implementation is designed to be overridden, allowing a
custom Promise library to be used.

```javascript
var mylib = require('myfavpromiseimplementation');
oracledb.Promise = mylib;
```

Promises can be completely disabled by setting

```javascript
oracledb.Promise = null;
```

## <a name="asyncawaitoverview"></a> 22. Async/Await and node-oracledb

Node.js 7.6 supports async functions, also known as Async/Await.  These
can be used with node-oracledb.  For example:

```javascript
const oracledb = require('oracledb');

function getEmployee(empid) {
  return new Promise(async function(resolve, reject) {
    let conn;

    try {
      conn = await oracledb.getConnection({
        user          : "hr",
        password      : "welcome",
        connectString : "localhost/XE"
      });

      let result = await conn.execute(
        'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :bv',
        [empid]
      );
      resolve(result.rows);

    } catch (err) { // catches errors in getConnection and the query
      reject(err);
    } finally {
      if (conn) {   // the conn assignment worked, must release
        try {
          await conn.release();
        } catch (e) {
          console.error(e);
        }
      }
    }
  });
}

async function run() {
  try {
    let res = await getEmployee(101);
    console.log(res);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

run();
```

If you are using [Lob instances](#lobclass) for LOB data instead of
working with the data directly as Strings or Buffers, then the Lobs
must be streamed since there is no Promisified interface for them.

For more information, see [How to get, use, and close a DB connection
using async functions][74].

## <a name="bindtrace"></a> <a name="tracingsql"></a> 23. Tracing SQL and PL/SQL Statements

####  End-to-End Tracing

Applications that have implemented [End-to-end Tracing](#endtoend)
calls such as [action](#propconnaction) and [module](#propconnmodule),
will make it easier in database monitoring tools to identify SQL
statement execution.

#### Tracing Executed Statements

Database statement tracing is commonly used to identify performance
issues.  Oracle Database trace files can be analyzed after statements
are executed.  Tracing can be enabled in various ways at a database
system or individal session level.  Refer to [Oracle Database Tuning
documentation][95].  Setting a customer identifier is recommended to
make searching for relevant log files easier:

```
ALTER SESSION SET tracefile_identifier='My-identifier' SQL_TRACE=TRUE
```

In node-oracledb itself, the [ODPI-C tracing capability][75] can be
used to log executed statements to the standard error stream.  Before
executing Node.js, set the environment variable `DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL`
to 16.  At a Windows command prompt, this could be done with `set
DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL=16`.  On Linux, you might use:

```
export DPI_DEBUG_LEVEL=16
node myapp.js 2> log.txt
```

For an application that does a single query, the log file might
contain a tracing line consisting of the prefix 'ODPI', a thread
identifier, a timestamp, and the SQL statement executed:

```
ODPI [6905309] 2017-09-13 09:02:46.140: SQL select sysdate from dual where :b = 1
```

#### Tracing Bind Values

Sometimes it is useful to trace the bind data values that have been
used when executing statements.  Several methods are available.

In the Oracle Database, the view [`V$SQL_BIND_CAPTURE`][76] can
capture bind information.  Tracing with Oracle Database's
[`dbms_monitor.session_trace_enable()`][77] may also be useful.

You can also write your own wrapper around `execute()` and log any
parameters.

#### Other Tracing Utilities

PL/SQL users may be interested in using [PL/Scope][78].

## <a name="migrate"></a> 24. Migrating from Previous node-oracledb Releases

### <a name="migratev1v2"></a> 24.1 Migrating from node-oracledb 1.13 to node-oracledb 2.0

When upgrading from node-oracledb version 1.13 to version 2.0:

- Review the [CHANGELOG][83].

- Installation has changed.  Pre-built binaries are available for
  common platforms.  To build from source code, change your
  package.json dependency to install from GitHub.  Refer to
  [INSTALL][80].

- Users of Instant Client RPMs must now always have the Instant Client
  libraries in the library search path.  Refer to [INSTALL][81].

- Users of macOS must now always have the Instant Client
  libraries in `~/lib` or `/usr/local/lib`.  Refer to [INSTALL][82].

- For queries and REF CURSORS, the internal buffer sizing and tuning
  of round-trips to Oracle Database is now done with
  [`fetchArraySize`](#propdbfetcharraysize).  This replaces
  [`prefetchRows`](#propdbprefetchrows), which is no longer used.  It
  also replaces the overloaded use of `maxRows` for
  [`queryStream()`](#querystream).  To upgrade scripts:

    - Replace the property `prefetchRows` with `fetchArraySize` and make
      sure all values are greater than 0.

    - Tune `fetchArraySize` instead of `maxRows` for `queryStream()`.

    - For [direct fetches](#fetchingrows), optionally tune
      `fetchArraySize`.

    - For [direct fetches](#fetchingrows), optionally replace enormously
      over-sized `maxRows` values with 0, meaning an unlimited number of
      rows can be returned.

- For [direct fetches](#fetchingrows) that relied on the version 1
  default value of [`maxRows`](#propdbmaxrows) to limit the number of
  returned rows to 100, it is recommended to use an [OFFSET /
  FETCH](#pagingdata) query clause.  Alternatively explicitly set
  `maxRows` to 100.

- Review and update code that checks for specific *NJS-XXX* or
  *DPI-XXX* error messages.

- Ensure that all [ResultSets](#resultsetclass) and [LOBs](#lobclass)
  are closed prior to calling
  [`connection.close()`](#connectionclose). Otherwise you will get the
  error *DPI-1054: connection cannot be closed when open statements or
  LOBs exist*.  (*Note*: this limitation was removed in node-oracledb 2.1)

- Test applications to check if changes such as the improved property
  validation uncover latent problems in your code.

### <a name="migratev20v21"></a> 24.2 Migrating from node-oracledb 2.0 to node-oracledb 2.1

When upgrading from node-oracledb version 2.0 to version 2.1:

- If using the experimental `_close` method with [Query
  Streaming](#streamingresults) in Node 8 or later:

    - Change the method name from `_close()` to [`destroy()`][92].
    - Stop passing a callback.
    - Optionally pass an error.
